<H1> Qt-based Plugins - QtImage </h1>

<p>
This sample plug-in demonstrates Qt used for developing
Netscape Plug-ins.
For this to work, you must either already have a PNG plugin (in which
case this example is not very interesting), or you must compile and install
the plugin code - type "make install" in the
<tt>extensions/nsplugin/examples/qtimage</tt> directory of your
Qt installation.

  This plugin displays a <a href=http://www.wco.com/~png/>PNG format</a> image.
  <p>
  With the simplicity and cross-platform nature of Qt-based plugins such
  as this, any new image format can be supported by adding new image
  I/O handlers to the Qt library, thus providing the functionality in both
  applications and WWW plugins from the same code.

<!--
<p>
Qt-based plugins can do more than just draw images.  Point at the graph,
and you will see a menubar - this and all the other GUI components of
the Qt C++ GUI toolkit are available to the plugin developer.

This plugin supports transparency and scaling of the image, just like
GIFs in most WWW browsers.
