<H1> Qt-based Plugins - Grapher </h1>

<p>
This sample plug-in demonstrates Qt used for developing
Netscape Plug-ins.
For this to work, you must compile and install
the plugin code - type "make install" in the
<tt>extensions/nsplugin/examples/grapher</tt> directory of your
Qt installation.

This plugin reads simple numeric data and displays a graph of the values.
The pie graph displayed here is drawn by the plugin from 
<a href=graph.data>just a few bytes of raw ASCII data</a>.
The data can come from any source, including
<a href=graph.cgi>a CGI source of graph data</a>.

<p>
With the simplicity and cross-platform nature of Qt-based plugins such
as this, pages like
<a href=http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/Changes/ALL/>Netcraft's
Server Graphs</a> can be provided much more efficiently for both
the service provider and consumer. No longer must all data be convert
to an image at the server.

<p>
Qt-based plugins can do more than just draw images.  Point at the graph,
and you will see a menubar - this and all the other GUI components of
the Qt C++ GUI toolkit are available to the plugin developer.
