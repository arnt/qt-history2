<h1 align=center>Qt-based LiveConnect Plugins for Netscape</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The Netscape WWW browser allows for Plugins software to be added to
support information presentation to supplement normal WWW browsing.
The Plugin interface is described fully
<a href=http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/plugins/index.html>
here</a>.

<p>
The Qt-based Netscape Plugin software makes it easy to write such plugins such
that they can be used on both Unix/Linux and Windows/95/NT.

<h2>How-to</h2>

To find out how to write Qt-based Netscape Plugins,
read the <a href=html/annotated.html>plugin class documentation</a>.

<h2>Examples</h2>

The following example programs are available to demonstrate the use of the
Qt GUI toolkit for making Plugins for Netscape.
<ul>
 <li><b><a href=examples/grapher/>Grapher</a></b> - graph data <em>without resorting to GIFs</em>
 <li><b><a href=examples/qtimage/>QtImage</a></b> - plugin for Qt-supported image formats, <em>including PNG.</em>
</ul>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
 <li> Some instability with Beta release Netscape Communicator.
 <li> When grabbing (eg. popup menus), should not stop trapping Dangerous
        events until the grabbing finishes.  Need QApplication to have
        test of need for this (eg. popupActive()).
 <li> Events to popups outside on-page widget area are slow?
 <li> When do we get keyboard focus?
</ul>
