<h1 align=center>Qt-based LiveConnect Plugins for Netscape and Explorer</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The Netscape and Explorer WWW browsers allow for Plugin software to be
added to support information presentation to supplement normal WWW
browsing.  The Plugin interface is described
<a href=http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/plugins/index.html>
in Netscape's handbook.</a>

<p>
The Qt-based Netscape Plugin software makes it easy to write such plugins such
that they can be used on both Unix/Linux and Windows/95/NT.

<h2>How-to</h2>

First, build the Netscape Plugin extension library, found in the
<tt>extensions/nsplugin/src</tt> directory of your Qt distribution.
Then, to find out how to write Qt-based Netscape Plugins,
read the <a href=html/annotated.html>plugin class documentation</a>, and
examine the example plugins listed below.
Note that under Windows, plugins must be named
<tt>np</tt><i>something</i><tt>.dll</tt>,
or the browser will ignore them.

<h2>Examples</h2>

The following example programs are available to demonstrate the use of the
Qt GUI toolkit for making Netscape Plugins.
<ul>
 <li><b><a href=examples/grapher/>Grapher</a></b>
	- graph your data <em>without resorting to GIFs</em>
 <li><b><a href=examples/qtimage/>QtImage</a></b>
	- plugin for Qt-supported image formats, <em>including PNG</em>
 <li><b><a href=examples/trivial/>Trivial</a></b>
	- plugin that does almost nothing
</ul>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

The Qt-based LiveConnect Plugin binding code has a number of bugs
that still make it impractical for production applications.  Most
of these have known solutions, and we are working on solving all
remaining problems.

<ul>
 <li> Some instability with Beta release Netscape Communicator for X11.
 <li> Crashes on Windows when Browser in backgrounded.
 <li> Popup windows can hang X server.
 <li> Keyboard problems on Windows.
</ul>
