  \title Editors in a Qt main window

  This example shows two simple text editors, with most of the
  program written in Qt.  One editor is a Qt QMultiLineEdit, the
  other is an Athena Widgets text widget.  They are bound together
  in a Qt main window.

  Implementation:

  \include mainlyQt/editor.cpp
