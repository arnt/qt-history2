\title Qt Xt/Motif Support Extension

The Qt Xt/Motif Support Extension assists the migration of old
Xt and Motif based code to the more comfortable Qt toolkit.

\section1 Information

The Qt Xt/Motif Extension consists of the following classes:
\list
\i \link qxtapplication.html QXtApplication \endlink allows mixing of
Xt/Motif and Qt widgets.
\i \link qxtwidget.html QXtWidget \endlink is the base widget for
Xt/Motif and Qt combination.
\endlist

\section1 How-to

\list 1

\i Ensure you are using X11R6.

\i Ensure the programs you wish to port are compilable by a C++
compiler, or at least that this is the case for the parts which need
migration.

\i Decide whether you are writing a new Qt application reusing old Xt
widgets, or introducing new Qt widgets into an existing Xt/Motif
application. See the corresponding \link xt-motif-examples.html
example programs. \endlink

\endlist

\section1 Known Bugs

This extension is under development. The following problems exist:

\list
\i The different focus models of Xt, Motif and Qt interfere.
\i Clipboard handling between Xt/Motif and Qt does not work properly.
\endlist
