		Qt OpenGL Extension - The QGL classes

QGLWidget (qglwidget.h) is a Qt wrapper class for OpenGL and Mesa. To use
OpenGL in your Qt application, create a subclass of QGLWidget and
implement two or more virtual functions. The file html/qgl.html contains
documentation for the GLWidget and related classes.

To learn how to use Qt with OpenGL, see the box example.  It does no
fancy OpenGL rendering, but it illustrates how things work together.
The gears example is a reworked example from the Mesa 2.0 distribution.

To compile and install the Qt OpenGL Extension, give the command
'make' in the qt/extensions/opngl/src directory. Of course, the Qt
library must already be compiled and installed.

The Makefile is set up to use the Mesa OpenGL library by default; if
you want to use SGI OpenGL, change the LIBS line in the Makefile
accordingly.

Note that the resulting library, qgl, does not use any of the
peripheral OpenGL libraries (GLU etc.). If you write a Qt/OpenGL
program that uses those, you will have to add the corresponding linker
options when you compile your application (for example, "-lMesaGLU" on
UNIX, "glu32.lib" on Windows).
