		Qt OpenGL Extension - The QGL classes

QGLWidget (qgl.h) is a Qt wrapper class for OpenGL and Mesa. To use OpenGL
in your Qt application, create a subclass of QGLWidget and implement two
or more virtual functions. The file html/qgl.html contains documentation
for the QGLWidget and related classes.

To learn how to use Qt with OpenGL, see the box example.  It does no fancy
OpenGL rendering, but it illustrates how things work together.  The gears
example is a reworked example from the Mesa 2.0 distribution.

To compile and install the Qt OpenGL Extension, give the command 'make' in
the qt/extensions/opengl/src directory.  Of course, the Qt library must
already be compiled and installed.

The makefiles are set up to use the MesaGL include files and libraries by
default; if you want to use SGI OpenGL, change the GL_INC setting in the
src/Makefile and the GL_INC and GL_LIBS settings in the example program
makefiles.

Note that the resulting library, qgl, does not use any of the peripheral
OpenGL libraries (GLU etc.).  If you write a Qt/OpenGL program that uses
those, you will have to add the corresponding linker options when you
compile your application (for example, "-lMesaGLU" on UNIX, "glu32.lib" on
Windows).
