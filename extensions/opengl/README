		     OpenGL for Qt - The QGL classes

QGLWidget (qglwidget.h) is a Qt wrapper class for OpenGL and Mesa. To use
OpenGL in your Qt application, create a subclass of QGLWidget and
implement two or more virtual functions. The file html/qgl.html contains
documentation for the GLWidget and related classes.

To learn how to use Qt with OpenGL, see the box example.  It does no
fancy OpenGL rendering, but it illustrates how things work together.
The gears example is a reworked example from the Mesa 2.0 distribution.
