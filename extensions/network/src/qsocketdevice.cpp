/*!
  \class QSocketDevice qsocketdevice.h
  \brief QSocketDevice provides a platform-independent low-level socket API.

  \extension Network

  This class is not really meant for use outside Qt.  It can be used
  for to achieve some things that QSocket does not provide, but it's
  not particularly easy to understand or use.

  The basic purpose of the class is to provide a QIODevice that works
  on sockets.  As such, it reimplements the

  \sa QSocket, QSocketNotifier, QHostAddress
*/

/*! \enum QSocketDevice::Error

This enum type describes the error states of QSocketDevice.  At
present these errors are defined: <ul>
  
<li> \c NoError - all is fine.

<li> \c AlreadyBound - bind() said so.

<li> \c Inaccessible - the operating system or firewall prohibits something.

<li> \c NoResources - the operating system ran out of something.

<li> \c Bug - there seems to be a bug in QSocketDevice.

<li> \c Impossible - the impossible happened, usually because you confused
QSocketDevice horribly.  Simple example:
\code
    ::close( sd->socket() );
    sd->writeBlock( someData, 42 );
\endcode
The libc ::close() closes the socket, but QSocketDevice is not aware
of that.  So when you call writeBlock(), the impossible happens.

<li> \c NoFiles - the operating system will not let QSocketDevice open
another file.

<li> \c ConnectionRefused - a connection attempt was rejected by the
peer.

<li> \c NetworkFailure - there is a network failure between this host
and... and whatever.

<li> \c UnknownError - the operating system reacted in a way that the
Qt developers did not foresee.

</ul>
