			 Qt Network Extension

These classes extend Qt with a platform-independent C++ API to
socket-based network communication.

This extension is currently in an unsupported, experimental
state. Even though no major API changes are expected, neither binary
nor source compatibility with future versions is guaranteed.

For this reason, applications should not be linked dynamically to the
Network Extension library. The library should be used as a static
library instead. The default make files build a static library.
