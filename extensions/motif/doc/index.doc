\section1 Introduction

The Qt Motif Extension assists the migration of old Xt and Motif based
applications to the more comfortable Qt toolkit.  This extension
replaces the older Xt/Motif Support Extension included with earlier
version of Qt.

The Qt Motif Extension consists of the following classes:

\list
\i \l QMotif - Provides the basis of the Qt Motif Extension.
\i \l QMotifWidget - Provides the QWidget API for Motif widgets.
\i \l QMotifDialog - Provides the QDialog API for Motif dialogs.
\i \l QXtWidget - The Xt/Motif integration widget from the previous
Xt/Motif extension.  This class is unsupported, and provided only for
projects moving to the new Motif extension.
\endlist
