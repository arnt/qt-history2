\keyword Motif

The Motif Extension assists the migration of old Xt and Motif based
code to the more comfortable Qt toolkit. This extension replaces the
older Qt Xt/Motif Support Extension included with earlier versions of
Qt.

\section1 Information

The Motif Extension consists of the follow classes:
\list
\i \l QMotif
\i \l QMotifWidget
\i \l QMotifDialog
\i \l QXtWidget - The Xt/Motif integration widget from the previous
Xt/Motif extension.  This class is unsupported, and provided only for
projects moving to the new Motif extension.
\endlist

\section1 How-to
   
\list 1
\i Ensure you are using X11R6 and Motif 2.x.
\i Ensure the programs you wish to port are compilable by a C++
compiler, or at least that this is the case for the parts which
need migration.
\endlist
