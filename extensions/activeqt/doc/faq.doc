    \section1 The ActiveQt build system

    To build Qt applications hosting ActiveX controls the application just 
    has to link against the qaxcontainer library by adding
    \code
    LIBS += <location>\qaxcontainer.lib
    \endcode
    To the .pro files used by \c qmake to generate a makefile. \c <location>
    is usually %QTDIR%\lib.

    To be able to build ActiveX controls with Qt the build system has to be
    extended with additional build steps that are used when the .pro file 
    includes \c activeqt in the \c CONFIG settings. The resulting makefile 
    will

    \list
    \i Link the executable against qaxserver.lib instead of qtmain.lib
    \i Call the resulting executable with the -dumpidl parameter to generate
    an IDL description of the ActiveX controls provided by the server.
    \i Compile the IDL into a type library using the MIDL tool
    \i Attach the resulting type library as a binary resource to the server
       executable
    \endlist

    Attaching resources to an executable is not supported by Windows95/98/ME,
    but a server built on Windows NT/2000/XP will work on those versions.

    \section1 Typical build problems
    
    The compiler/linker errors listed are based on those issued by the 
    Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler.

    \section2 Compiler errors

    \section3 "No overloaded function takes 2 parameters"
    
    When the error occurs in code that uses the QAXFACTORY_DEFAULT macro
    the widget class had no constructor that can be used by the default
    factory. Either add a standard widget constructor, or implement a custom
    factory that doesn't require that.

    When the error occurs in code that uses the QAXFACTORY_EXPORT macro
    the QAxFactory subclass had no appropriate constructor. Provide a public 
    class constructor like
    \code
    MyFactory( const QUuid &, const QUuid & );
    \endcode
    for your factory class.

    \section3 "syntax error: bad suffix on number"

    The unique identifiers have not been passed as strings into the 
    QAXFACTORY_EXPORT or QAXFACTORY_DEFAULT macro.

    \section2 Linker errors

    \section3 "unresolved external symbol _ucm_instantiate"

    The server does not export an implementation of a QAxFactory. Use the
    QAXFACTORY_EXPORT macro in one implementation file of the project to
    instantiate and export a factory, or use the QAXFACTORY_DEFAULT macro
    to use the default factory.

    \section3 "_ucm_initialize already defined in ..."

    The server exports more than one implementation of a QAxFactory, or the
    same implementation twice. The QAXFACTORY_EXPORT and QAXFACTORY_DEFAULT
    macros must only be used once in the project. Use a custom QAxFactory
    implementation if the server should provide multiple ActiveX controls.

    \section3 "unresolved external symbol _main"

    The application does not provide an entry point function "main". Implement
    a main function like for any other Qt program, and use QAxFactory::isServer()
    to prevent or modify stand-alone execution of the application.
    \code
    int main( int argc, char **argv )
    {
        QApplication app( argc, argv );

        if ( !QAxFactory::isServer() ) {
            QMessageBox::critical( 0, "Cannot run stand-alone!",
                                      "This executable is a server for ActiveX controls." );
            return -1;
        }

        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    \section3 "cannot open file ... "

    The ActiveX server could not shut down properly when the last client stopped
    using it. It usually takes about two seconds for the application to terminate,
    but you might have to use the task manager to kill the process (e.g. when a
    client doesn't release the controls properly).

    \section1 Debugging runtime errors

    To debug the server, run the application in a debugger and start with the
    commandline parameter "-activex". COM will use the existing process for the 
    next client trying to create an ActiveX control.
