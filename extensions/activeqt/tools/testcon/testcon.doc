    \title An ActiveX Test Container

    This application implements a generic test container for ActiveX
    controls. You can insert ActiveX controls installed on your
    system, and execute methods and modify properties. The container
    will log information about events and property changes as well
    as debug output in the log window.

    The GUI has been implemented utilizing the Qt Designer integration
    of the QAxContainer module. Parts of the code use internals of the Qt
    meta object and ActiveQt framework and are not recommended to be used in
    application code.

    Use the application to view the slots, signals and porperties 
    available through the QAxWidget class when instantiated with a 
    certain ActiveX, and to test ActiveX controls you implement.

    Note that the qmake project of this example includes a resource file
    \c testcon.rc with a version resource. This is required by some
    ActiveX controls (ie. Shockwave ActiveX Controls), which might crash
    or misbehave otherwise if such version information is missing.

    To build the tool you must first build the
    \link qaxcontainer.html QAxContainer \endlink library.
    Then run your make tool in \c tools/testcon and
    run the resulting \c testcon.exe.
