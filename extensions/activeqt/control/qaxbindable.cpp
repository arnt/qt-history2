    \class QAxBindable qaxbindable.h
    \brief The QAxBindable class provides an interface between the QWidget and the ActiveX client.

    \module QAxServer
    \extension ActiveQt

    The functions provided by this class allow the ActiveX control to
    communicate property changes to the client application. Inherit
    your control class from both QWidget (directly or indirectly) and
    this class to get access to this class's functions. The meta
    object compiler requires you to inherit from QWidget \e first.

    \code
    class MyActiveX : public QWidget, public QAxBindable
    {
	Q_OBJECT
	Q_PROPERTY( int value READ value WRITE setValue )
    public:
	MyActiveX( QWidget *parent = 0, const char *name = 0 );
	...

        int value() const;
	void setValue( int );
    };
    \endcode

    When implementing the property write function, use
    requestPropertyChange() to get permission from the ActiveX client
    application to change this property. When the property changes,
    call propertyChanged() to notify the ActiveX client application
    about the change.

    Use the interface returned by clientSite() to call the ActiveX client. To 
    implement additional COM interfaces in your ActiveX control, reimplement
    createAggregate() to return a new object of a QAxAggregated subclass.

    Call this function to request permission to change the property

    Returns TRUE if the client allows the change; otherwise returns

    This function is usually called first in the write function for \a
    property, and writing is abandoned if the function returns FALSE.

/*! \class QAxAggregated qaxbindable.h
    \brief The QAxAggregated class is an abstract base class for implementations of
    additional COM interfaces.
    \module QAxServer
    \extension ActiveQt

    Create a subclass of QAxAggregated and reimplement queryInterface to support
    additional COM interfaces. Use multiple inheritance from those COM interfaces.
    Implement the IUnknown interface of those COM interfaces by delegating the
    calls to QueryInterface, AddRef and Release to the interface provided by
    controllingUnknown().
    
    Use the widget() method if you need to make calls to the QWidget implementing the 
    ActiveX control. You must not store that pointer in your subclass (unless you use
    QGuardedPtr), as the QWidget can be destroyed by the ActiveQt framework at any time.

QAxAggregated::~QAxAggregated()

/*! \fn long QAxAggregated::queryInterface( const QUuid &iid, void **iface )

    Reimplement this pure virtual function to support additional COM interfaces.
    Set the value of \a iface to point to this object to support the interface \a iid.
    Note that you have to cast the \c this pointer to the respective superclass.

    \code
    long AxImpl::queryInterface( const QUuid &iid, void **iface )
    {
        *iface = 0;
	if ( iid == IID_ISomeCOMInterface )
	    *iface = (ISomeCOMInterface*)this;
	else
	    return E_NOINTERFACE;

	AddRef();
	return S_OK;
    }
    \endcode

    Return the standard COM results S_OK (interface is supported) or E_NOINTERFACE
    (requested interface is not supported).

    \warning
    Even though you have to implement the IUnknown interface if you implement any
    COM interface you must not support the IUnknown interface in your queryInterface
    implementation.
*/

/*!
    \fn IUnknown *QAxAggregated::controllingUnknown() const

    Returns the IUnknown interface of the ActiveX control. Implement the IUnknown
    interface in your QAxAggregated subclass to delegate calls to QueryInterface, 
    AddRef and Release to the interface provided by this function.

    \code
    HRESULT AxImpl::QueryInterface( REFIID iid, void **iface )
    {
        return controllingUnknown()->QueryInterface( iid, iface );
    }

    unsigned long AxImpl::AddRef()

    }

    unsigned long AxImpl::Release()
    {
        return controllingUnknown()->Release();
    }

    The QAXAGG_IUNKNOWN macro expands to that, and you can use it in the
    class declaration of your subclass.

/*! 
    \fn QObject *QAxAggregated::object() const

    You must not store the returned pointer, as the QObject can be destroyed by 
    ActiveQt at any time.
*/

/*!
    \fn QWidget *QAxAggregated::widget() const

    Returns a pointer to the QWidget subclass implementing the ActiveX control.
    This function might return zero.

    ActiveQt at any time.
