  \title An ActiveX Test Container


  This application implements a generic test container for ActiveX
  controls. You can insert ActiveX controls installed on your
  system, and execute methods and modify properties. The container
  will log information about events and property changes as well
  as debug output in the log window.

  The example GUI has been implemented utilizing the Qt Designer integration
  of the QAxContainer module. Parts of the code use internals of the Qt
  meta object and ActiveQt framework and are not recommended to be used in
  application code.

  Use the application to view the slots, signals and porperties 
  available through the QAxWidget class when instantiated with a 
  certain ActiveX, and to test ActiveX controls you implement.

  To build the example you must first build the
  \link qaxcontainer.html QAxContainer \endlink library.
  Then run your make tool in \c examples/testcon and
  run the resulting \c testcon.exe.
