You will need the Oracle development headers and libraries installed
before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.



Notes on Unix/Linux:

All files required to build driver should ship with the standard Oracle
install. For Linux, it may be possible to copy headers from another
platform's install.

Oracle library files required to build driver:

libclntsh.so
libclntsh.so.8.0
libwtc8.so

Oracle header files required to build driver:

nzerror.h
nzt.h
oci.h
oci1.h
oci8dp.h
ociap.h
ociapr.h
ocidef.h
ocidem.h
ocidfn.h
ociextp.h
ocikp.h
ocikpr.h
odci.h
oratypes.h
ori.h
orid.h
orl.h
oro.h
ort.h

Tell qmake where to find the Oracle header files and shared libraries
(here it is assumed that Oracle is installed in /usr/local) and run make:

cd $QTDIR/plugins/src/sqldrivers/oci
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/include" "LIBS+=-L/usr/local/lib -lclntsh -lwtc8" oci.pro
make



Notes on Windows:

Choosing the option "Programmer" in the Oracle Client Installer from
the Oracle Client Installation CD is sufficient to build the plugin. 

Build the plugin as follows (here it is assumed that Oracle Client is
installed in C:\oracle):

cd %QTDIR%\plugins\src\sqldrivers\oci
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=C:\oracle\oci\include" oci.pro
nmake

If you are using a Borland compiler, replace "nmake" with "make" in the
statement above.

Please note that the Makefile may not contain path names with special
characters like spaces, so it is recommended that you use the 8.3 filename
equivalent instead.
 
Example: If Oracle is installed in "C:\program files\oracle", use the
following path as an argument for qmake: "C:\progra~1\oracle"
