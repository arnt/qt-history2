You will need the MySQL development headers and libraries installed
before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.



Notes on Unix/Linux:

You need the MySQL header files and as well as the shared library
"libmysqlclient.so". Depending on your Linux distribution you need
a package called "MySQL-devel" or "mysql-devel". Install it.

Tell qmake where to find the MySQL header files and shared libraries
(here it is assumed that MySQL is installed in /usr/local) and run make:

cd $QTDIR/plugins/src/sqldrivers/mysql
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/include" "LIBS+=-L/usr/local/libs -lmysqlclient" mysql.pro
make



Notes on Windows:

You need to get the MySQL installation files. Run SETUP.EXE and
choose "Custom Install". Install the "Libs & Include Files" Module.
Build the plugin as follows (here it is assumed that MySQL is
installed in C:\MYSQL):

cd %QTDIR%\PLUGINS\SRC\SQLDRIVERS\MYSQL
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=C:\MYSQL\INCLUDE" "LIBS+=C:\MYSQL\LIB\OPT\LIBMYSQL.LIB" mysql.pro
nmake

If you are using a Borland compiler, replace "nmake" with "make" in the
statement above.

Please note that the Makefile may not contain path names with special
characters like space, so it is recommended that you use the 8.3 filename
equivalent instead.

Example: If MySQL is installed in "C:\PROGRAM FILES\MYSQL", use the
following path as an argument for qmake: "C:\PROGRA~1\MYSQL"
