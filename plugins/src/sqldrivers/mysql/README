You will need the MySQL development headers and libraries installed
before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.



Notes on Linux / Unix:

You need the MySQL include files and shared libraries. Depending
on your Linux distribution it should be a package called 
"MySQL-devel". Install it and tell qmake where to find the files:

cd $QTDIR/plugins/src/sqldrivers/mysql
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/include" "LIBS+=-L/usr/local/libs -lmysqlclient" mysql.pro 
make

The Plugin needs the MySQL include files as well as the library "libmysqlclient.so"



Notes on Windows:

You need to get the MySQL installation files. Run SETUP.EXE and
choose "Custom Install". Install the "Libs & Include Files" Module.
Change to your QT SQL Driver directory (usually C:\QT\PLUGINS\SRC\SQLDRIVERS\MYSQL)
and run qmake as follows (assuming that MySQL is installed in C:\MYSQL):

qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=C:\MYSQL\INCLUDE" "LIBS+=C:\MYSQL\LIB\OPT\LIBMYSQL.LIB" mysql.pro

Finally call "nmake" (or a similar "make" utility) to build the plugin.

Please note that the Makefile may not contain path names with special chars
like space, so it is recommended to use the 8.3 Filename instead.

Example: If MySQL is installed in "C:\program files\mysql", use the
following path as argument for qmake: "C:\progra~1\mysql"
