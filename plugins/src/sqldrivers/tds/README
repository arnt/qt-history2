You will need the TDS development headers and libraries
installed before compiling this plugin.

Under Windows, use the DB-Library supplied by Microsoft. You have to 
include NTWDBLIB.LIB to build the plugin:

qmake -o Makefile "LIBS+=NTWDBLIB.LIB" tds.pro

If you want to force the use of the Sybase Open Client under windows,
you have to define Q_USE_SYBASE (look at qsql_tds.cpp).

 

Under Unix, two libraries are available which support the TDS protocol:

- FreeTDS, a free implementation of the TDS protocol. (www.freetds.org)
  Note that FreeTDS is not yet stable and may crash.

- Sybase Open Client, available from www.sybase.com
  Note for Linux users: Get the Open Client RPM from linux.sybase.com

Regardless of which library you use, the library "libsybdb.so" is needed.
set the SYBASE environment variable to point to the directory where you
installed the library and execute qmake:

qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH=$SYBASE/include" "LIBS=-L$SYBASE/lib -lsybdb"



See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.
