You will need the PostgreSQL development headers and libraries installed
before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.



Notes for PostgreSQL under Unix/Linux:

Just installing "libpq.so" and the corresponding header files is
unfortunately not sufficient. You have to get the whole source
distribution (www.postgresql.org) and run the configure script
once (there is no need to build it if you have already installed
a binary distribution).

Tell qmake where to find the PostgreSQL header files and shared
libraries (here it is assumed that you extracted the PostgreSQL
source code in /usr/src/psql and the shared library is installed
in /usr/lib) and run make:

cd $QTDIR/plugins/src/sqldrivers/psql
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/src/psql/src/include /usr/src/psql/src/interfaces/libpq" "LIBS+=-L/usr/lib -lpq" psql.pro
make
