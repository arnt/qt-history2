You will need the PostgreSQL development headers and libraries
installed before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.


Special notes for PostgreSQL under Linux/Unix:

Just installing libpq.so and the corresponding header files is
unfortunately not sufficient. You have to get the whole source
distribution (look at www.postgresql.org) and run the configure
script once (there is no need to build it if you already
installed a binary distribution).

Then go into the QT psql module directory (usually it is
$QTDIR/src/sql/src/psql) and start qmake with the following
parameters (it is assumed that you extracted the PostgreSQL
source code in /usr/src/psql and the libpq.so library is
installed in /usr/lib)

qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH=/usr/src/psql/src/include 
/usr/src/psql/src/interfaces/libpq" "LIBS=-L/usr/lib -lpq" psql.pro

Finally run make to build the PostgreSQL plugin.
