You will need ODBC development headers and libraries installed
before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.


Notes on Unix/Linux ODBC:

It is recommended that you use unixODBC. You can find the newest version
on www.unixodbc.org.

To compile the QODBC3 plugin you have to issue the following command in
$QTDIR/plugins/src/sqldrivers/odbc (it is assumed that unixODBC is installed in
/usr/local/unixODBC):

qmake "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/unixODBC/include" 
"LIBS+=-L/usr/local/unixODBC/lib -lodbc"

then run make to build the plugin. Look at the unixODBC website for
available ODBC drivers.



Notes on Windows:

The ODBC header and include files should already be installed in the
right directories. You just have to build the plugin as follows:

cd %QTDIR%\plugins\src\sqldrivers\odbc
qmake -o Makefile odbc.pro
nmake

If you are using a Borland compiler, replace "nmake" with "make" in the statement
above.
