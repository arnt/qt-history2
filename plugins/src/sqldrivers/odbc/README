You will need ODBC development headers and libraries installed before
compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.



Notes on Unix/Linux ODBC:

It is recommended that you use unixODBC. You can find the newest
version on www.unixodbc.org. You need the unixODBC header files
and shared libraries.

Tell qmake where to find the unixODBC header files and shared libraries
(here it is assumed that unixODBC is installed in /usr/local/unixODBC)
and run make:

cd $QTDIR/plugins/src/sqldrivers/odbc
qmake "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/unixODBC/include" "LIBS+=-L/usr/local/unixODBC/lib -lodbc"
make

Look at the unixODBC website for available ODBC drivers.



Notes on Windows:

The ODBC header and include files should already be installed in the
right directories. You just have to build the plugin as follows:

cd %QTDIR%\PLUGINS\SRC\SQLDRIVERS\ODBC
qmake -o Makefile odbc.pro
nmake

If you are using a Borland compiler, replace "nmake" with "make" in the
statement above.
