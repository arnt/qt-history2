  \brief A Unicode character.

  A QChar is a simple 16-bit value representing a Unicode character.
  Most C++ compilers will process them much as they would a "short int".

  QChar values are normally used in combination with QString.

  They can be trivially constructed from:
   <dl>
    <dt>\c char
      <dd>the char is assumed to be a Latin-1 character,
	    for example QChar('Q') is the Unicode character U0051
	    and QChar('t') is the Unicode character U0074.
    <dt>\c short
      <dd>the MSB is the high-order byte (row) of the Unicode character,
	    for example QChar(ushort(0x6817)) is the Unicode character
	    U6817 meaning <em>kuri</em> - chestnut tree - in Japanese.
    <dt>\c char, \c char
      <dd>the characters are LSB and MSB respectively,
	    for example QChar(0x25,0x04) is the Unicode character U0425
	    which is the Cyrillic letter YA which looks like a mirrored R.
   </dl>

  \class QString qstring.h

  \brief The QString class provides an abstraction of Unicode text and
          the classic C zero-terminated char array (<var>char*</var>).

  \ingroup tools
  \ingroup shared

  QString uses implicit
  \link shclass.html sharing\endlink, and so it is very efficient
  and easy to use.

  In all QString methods that take <var>const char*</var> parameters,
  the <var>const char*</var> is interpreted as a classic C-style
  0-terminated ASCII string. It is legal for the <var>const
  char*</var> parameter to be 0. The results are undefined if the
  <var>const char*</var> string is not 0-terminated. Functions that
  copy classic C strings into a QString will not copy the terminating
  0-character. The QChar array of the QString (as returned by
  unicode()) is not terminated by a null.

  A QString that has not been assigned to anything is \a null, i.e. both
  the length and data pointer is 0. A QString that references the empty
  string ("", a single '\0' char) is \a empty.	Both null and empty
  QStrings are legal parameters to the methods. Assigning <var>const char
  * 0</var> to QString gives a null QString.

  Note that if you find that you are mixing usage of QCString, QString,
  and QByteArray, this causes lots of unnecessary copying and might
  indicate that the true nature of the data you are dealing with is
  uncertain.  If the data is NUL-terminates 8-bit data, use QCString;
  if it is unterminated (ie. contains NULs) 8-bit daya, use QByteArray;
  if it is text, use QString.

  Safely builds a formatted string from a format string and an
