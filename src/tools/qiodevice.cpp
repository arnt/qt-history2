  \class QIODevice qiodevice.h

  \brief The QIODevice class is the base class of I/O devices.

  \ingroup io

  An I/O device represents a medium that one can read bytes from
  and/or write bytes to.  The QIODevice class is the abstract
  superclass of all such devices; classes such as QFile, QBuffer and
  QSocket inherit QIODevice and implement virtual functions such as
  write() appropriately.

  Although applications sometimes use QIODevice directly, it is
  usually better to go through QTextStream and QDataStream, which provide
  stream operations on any QIODevice subclass.  QTextStream provides
  text-oriented stream functionality (for human-readable ASCII files,
  for example), whereas QDataStream deals with binary data in a totally
  platform-independent manner.

  The public member functions in QIODevice roughly fall into two
  groups: the action functions and the state access functions.  The
  most important action functions are:

  \list

  \i  open() opens a device for reading and/or writing, depending on
  the argument to open().

  \i  close() closes the device and tidies up.

  \i  readBlock() reads a block of data from the device.

  \i  writeBlock() writes a block of data to the device.

  \i  readLine() reads a line (of text, usually) from the device.

  \i  flush() ensures that all buffered data are written to the real device.

  \endlist

  There are also some other, less used, action functions:

  \list

  \i  getch() reads a single character.

  \i  ungetch() forgets the last call to getch(), if possible.

  \i  putch() writes a single character.

  \i  size() returns the size of the device, if there is one.

  \i  at() returns the current read/write pointer's position, if there
  is one for this device, or it moves the pointer.

  \i  atEnd() says whether there is more to read, if that is a
  meaningful question for this device.

  \i  reset() moves the read/write pointer to the start of the
  device, if that is possible for this device.

  \endlist

  The state access are all "get" functions.  The QIODevice subclass
  calls setState() to update the state, and simple access functions
  tell the user of the device what the device's state is.  Here are
  the settings, and their associated access functions:

  \list

  \i  Access type.  Some devices are direct access (it is possible to
  read/write anywhere), whereas others are sequential.  QIODevice
  provides the access functions (isDirectAccess(), isSequentialAccess(),
  and isCombinedAccess()) to tell users what a given I/O device
  supports.

  \i  Buffering.  Some devices are accessed in raw mode, whereas others
  are buffered.  Buffering usually provides greater efficiency,
  particularly for small read/write operations.  isBuffered() tells
  the user whether a given device is buffered.  (This can often be set
  by the application in the call to open().)

  \i  Synchronicity.  Synchronous devices work immediately (for
  example, files).  When you read from a file, the file delivers its
  data straight away.  Other kinds of device, such as a socket
  connected to a HTTP server, may not deliver the data until seconds
  after you ask to read it.  isSynchronous() and isAsynchronous() tell
  the user how this device operates.

  \i  CR/LF translation.  For simplicity, applications often like to
  see just a single CR/LF style, and QIODevice subclasses can provide
  this.  isTranslated() returns TRUE if this object translates CR/LF
  to just LF.  (This can often be set by the application in the call
  to open().)

  \i  Accessibility.  Some files cannot be written. For example,
  isReadable(), isWritable, and isReadWrite() tell the application
  whether it can read from and write to a given device.  (This can
  often be set by the application in the call to open().)

  \i  Finally, isOpen() returns TRUE if the device is open, i.e. after
  an open() call.

  \endlist

  QIODevice provides numerous pure virtual functions that you need to
  implement when subclassing it.  Here is a skeleton subclass with all
  the members you are certain to need and some that you probably
  will need:

  \code
    class MyDevice : public QIODevice
    {
    public:
	MyDevice();
       ~MyDevice();

	bool open( int mode );
	void close();
	void flush();

	uint size() const;
	int  at() const;	// not a pure virtual function
	bool at( int );		// not a pure virtual function
	bool atEnd() const;	// not a pure virtual function

	int readBlock( char *data, uint maxlen );
	int writeBlock( const char *data, uint len );
	int readLine( char *data, uint maxlen );

	int getch();
	int putch( int );
	int ungetch( int );
    };
  \endcode

  The three non-pure virtual functions can be ignored if your device
  is sequential (e.g., an RS-232 port).

  \i \c IO_Append sets the file index to the end of the file.
  \i \c IO_Truncate truncates the file.
  \i \c IO_Translate enables carriage returns and linefeed translation
  for text files under MS-DOS, Windows and Macintosh.  On Unix systems
  this flag has no effect. Use with caution as it will also transform
  every linefeed written to the file into a CRLF pair. This is likely to
  corrupt your file if you write write binary data. Cannot be combined
  with \c IO_Raw.
