You will need ODBC development headers and libraries installed
before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.


Notes on Unix/Linux ODBC:

It is recommended that you use unixODBC. You can find the newest version
on www.unixodbc.org.

To compile the QODBC3 plugin you have to issue the following command in
$QTDIR/src/sql/src/odbc (it is assumed that unixODBC is installed in
/usr/local/unixODBC):

qmake "INCLUDEPATH=/usr/local/unixODBC/include" 
"LIBS=-L/usr/local/unixODBC/lib -lodbc"

then run make to build the plugin. Look at the unixODBC website for
available ODBC drivers.
