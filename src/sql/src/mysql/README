You will need the MySQL development headers and libraries installed
before compiling this plugin.

See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.


Notes on Linux / Unix:

You need the MySQL include files and shared libraries. Depending
on your Linux distribution it should be a package called 
MySQL-devel. Install it and tell qmake where to find the files:

cd $QTDIR/src/sql/src/mysql
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH=/usr/local/include" "LIBS=-L/usr/local/libs -lmysqlclient" mysql.pro 
make
