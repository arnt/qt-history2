Qt OCI Driver


Notes on Linux / Unix

All files required to build driver should ship with the standard Oracle install.
For Linux, it may be possible to copy headers from another platform's install.

Oracle lib files required to build driver:

libclntsh.so
libclntsh.so.8.0
libwtc8.so

Oracle header files required to build driver:

nzerror.h
nzt.h
oci.h
oci1.h
oci8dp.h
ociap.h
ociapr.h
ocidef.h
ocidem.h
ocidfn.h
ociextp.h
ocikp.h
ocikpr.h
odci.h
oratypes.h
ori.h
orid.h
orl.h
oro.h
ort.h


Issue the following commands to build the plugin

cd $QTDIR/src/sql/src/oci
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH=/usr/local/include" "LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -lclntsh -lwtc8" oci.pro
make

Replace the paths corresponding to where the libraries and headers have been
installed to.



Notes on Windows

Choosing the option "Programmer" in the Oracle Client Installer from the
Oracle Client Installation CD is sufficient to build the plugin. 

To build the plugins the following commands are neccesarry (assuming
that QT was installed in C:\QT and Oracle Client in C:\ORACLE):

cd \qt\src\sql\src\oci
qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH=C:\ORACLE\OCI\INCLUDE" "LIBS=C:\ORACLE\OCI\LIB\MSVC\OCI.LIB" oci.pro
nmake

If you are using a Borland compiler, replace "MSVC" with "BC" in the statement
above.

Please note that the Makefile may not contain path names with special chars
like space, so it is recommended to use the 8.3 Filename instead.
 
Example: If Oracle is installed in "c:\program files\Oracle", use the
following path as argument for qmake: "C:\progra~1\oracle"



See the Qt SQL documentation for more information on compiling Qt SQL
driver plugins.
