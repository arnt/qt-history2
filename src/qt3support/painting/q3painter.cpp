    \class Q3Painter q3painter.h
    \brief Q3Painter is the compat version of QPainter.

    \compat

    Prior to Qt 4, QPainter specialized the pen drawing for rectangle
    based functions (in particular: drawRect, drawEllipse,
    drawRoundRect, drawArc, drawChord and drawPie). When stroking a
    rectangle of width 10, the pen would draw a rectangle of width 10.
    Drawing a polygon defined by the corner points of the same
    rectangle the stroke would have a width of 11.

    The reason for this is best explained using the picture below:

    \img q3painter_rationale.png

    As we can see, stroking the rectangle so it gets a width of 10,
    means the pen is drawn on a rectangle on width 9. The polygon,
    however follows a consistent model.

    In Qt 4, all rectangle based functions have changed to follow the
    polygon approach, which means that the rectangle defines the size of
    the fill, and the pen follows the edges of the shape. For pen widths
    of 0 and 1 this means that the stroke will be inside the shape on the
    left and the top and outside on the bottom and right.

    The reason for the change in Qt 4 is so that we provide consistency
    for all drawing functions even with complex transformations.
