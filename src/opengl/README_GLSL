Use of GLSL for vertex and fragment programs in Qt
-------------------------------------------------

We don't distribute the *.glsl files because we don't want the build process of
Qt to require cgc from nVidia to build the fragment programs.

The script src/opengl/glsl_to_include.sh will compile a GLSL program to a file
that can be included in a C(++) program. The file is the output from cgc
quoted as a string.

This can be done manually by:

./glsl_to_include.sh -o radial.frag radial.glsl
./glsl_to_include.sh -o conical.frag conical.glsl
