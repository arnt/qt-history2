    \class QObjectCleanupHandler
    \brief The QObjectCleanupHandler class watches the lifetime of multiple QObjects.

    \ingroup objectmodel

    A QObjectCleanupHandler is useful whenever you need to know when a
    number of \l{QObject}s that are owned by someone else have been
    deleted. This is important, for example, when referencing memory
    in an application that has been allocated in a shared library.

    To keep track of some \l{QObject}s, create a
    QObjectCleanupHandler, and add() the objects you are interested
    in. If you are no longer interested in tracking a particular
    object, use remove() to remove it from the cleanup handler. If an
    object being tracked by the cleanup handler gets deleted by
    someone else it will automatically be removed from the cleanup
    handler. You can delete all the objects in the cleanup handler
    with clear(), or by destroying the cleanup handler. isEmpty()
    returns true if the QObjectCleanupHandler has no objects to keep
    track of.
