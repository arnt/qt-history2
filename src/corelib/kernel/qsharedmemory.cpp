  \class QSharedMemory
  \since 4.4

  \brief The QSharedMemory class provides access to a shared memory segment.

  QSharedMemory provides access to a shared memory segment by multiple
  threads and processes. It also provides a way for a single thread or
  process to lock the memory for exclusive access.

  When using this class, be aware of the following platform
  differences:

  \list

  \o Windows: QSharedMemory does not "own" the shared memory segment.
  When all threads or processes that have an instance of QSharedMemory
  attached to a particular shared memory segment have either destroyed
  their instance of QSharedMemory or exited, the Windows kernel
  releases the shared memory segment automatically.

  \o Unix: QSharedMemory "owns" the shared memory segment. When the
  last thread or process that has an instance of QSharedMemory
  attached to a particular shared memory segment detaches from the
  segment by destroying its instance of QSharedMemory, the Unix kernel
  release the shared memory segment. But if that last thread or
  process crashes without running the QSharedMemory destructor, the
  shared memory segment survives the crash.

  \o HP-UX: Only one attach to a shared memory segment is allowed per
  process. This means that QSharedMemeory should not be used across
  multiple threads in the same process in HP-UX.

  \endlist

  Remember to lock the shared memory with lock() before reading from
  or writing to the shared memory, and remember to release the lock
  with unlock() after you are done. 

  Unlike QtSharedMemory, QSharedMemory automatically destroys the
  shared memory segment when the last instance of QSharedMemory is
  detached from the segment, and no references to the segment
  remain. Do not mix using QtSharedMemory and QSharedMemory. Port
  everything to QSharedMemory.
