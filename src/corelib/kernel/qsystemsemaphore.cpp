  \class QSystemSemaphore
  \since 4.4

  \brief The QSystemSemaphore class provides a general system counting semaphore.

  A semaphore is a generalization of a mutex. While a mutex can only
  be locked once, it's possible to acquire a semaphore multiple
  times. Semaphores are typically used to protect a certain number of
  identical resources.  With a system semaphore multiple threads or
  processes can access the same semaphore.

  There are some platform difference that should be known when using this class:

  * On Windows once all of the QSystemSemaphore have been destroyed or
    crashed the semaphore is automatically removed.

  * On Unix if the process that owns the QSystemSemaphore crashes the
    semaphore is not automatically removed.  When setting the key you
    can force QSystemSemaphore to take ownership if it already exists
    and reset the number of resources to the requested amount.  * On
    Unix once the process exits Unix will automatically undo any
    operations that occurred. So if a process acquires and then exits
    Unix will automatically release one.

  Semaphores support two fundamental operations, acquire() and release():

  acquire() tries to acquire 1 resource. If there aren't that many
  resources available, the call will block until this is the case.

  release(n) releases n resources.

  A system semaphore needs a key that every process can use to access
  the same semaphore.

  Example:
    QSemaphore sem("market", 3);      // semaphore available == 3

    sem.acquire();         // semaphores available == 2
    sem.acquire();         // semaphores available == 1
    sem.acquire();         // semaphores available == 0
    sem.release(5);         // semaphores available == 5
    sem.release(5);         // semaphores available == 10

  A typical application of system semaphores is for controlling access
  to a circular buffer shared by a producer process and a consumer
  processes.

  \value Open If the semaphore already exists initialValue is not set.
  If the semaphore doesn't exists it will be created and the
  initialValue is set. On Unix after creating QSystemSemaphore will
  take ownership of the semaphore and remove it when QSystemSemaphore
  is destroyed.


  \value Create On Unix QSystemSemaphore will take ownership of the
  semaphore and set initialValue even if it already exists.  This is
  used when the first semaphore for this key is constructed and you
  know that any existing semaphore could only exists from a crash.
  This applies to Unix where system semaphores will survive a crash.
  On windows Create does the exact same behavior as Open as semaphores
  do not survive a crash.
