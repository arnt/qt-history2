    \class QThread
    \brief The QThread class provides platform-independent threads.

    \ingroup thread
    \ingroup environment
    \mainclass

    A QThread represents a separate thread of control within the
    program; it shares data with all the other threads within the
    process but executes independently in the way that a separate
    program does on a multitasking operating system. Instead of
    starting in \c main(), QThreads begin executing in run().
    To create your own threads, subclass QThread and reimplement
    run(). For example:

    \code
        class MyThread : public QThread
        {
        public:
            void run();
        };

        void MyThread::run()
        {
            QTcpSocket socket;
            // connect QTcpSocket's signals somewhere meaningful
            ...
            socket.connectToHost(hostName, portNumber);
            exec();
        }
    \endcode

    This will create a QTcpSocket in the thread and then execute the
    thread's event loop. Use the start() method to begin execution.
    Execution ends when you return from run(), just as an application
    does when it leaves main(). QThread will notifiy you via a signal
    when the thread is started(), finished(), and terminated(), or
    you can use isFinished() and isRunning() to query the state of
    the thread. Use wait() to block until the thread has finished
    execution.

    Each thread gets its own stack from the operating system. The
    operating system also determines the default size of the stack.
    You can use setStackSize() to set a custom stack size.

    Each QThread can have its own event loop. You can start the event
    loop by calling exec(); you can stop it by calling exit() or
    quit(). Having an event loop in a thread makes it possible to
    connect signals from other threads to slots in this threads,
    using a mechanism called \l{Qt::QueuedConnection}{queued
    connections}. It also makes it possible to use classes that
    require the event loop, such as QTimer and QTcpSocket, in the
    thread.

    In extreme cases, you may want to forcibly terminate() an
    executing thread. However, doing so is dangerous and discouraged.
    Please read the documentation for terminate() and
    setTerminationEnabled() for detailed information.

    The static functions currentThreadId() and currentThread() return
    identifiers for the currently executing thread. The former
    returns a platform specific ID for the thread; the latter returns
    a QThread pointer.

    QThread also provides platform independent sleep functions in
    varying resolutions. Use sleep() for full second resolution,
    msleep() for millisecond resolution, and usleep() for microsecond
    resolution.
