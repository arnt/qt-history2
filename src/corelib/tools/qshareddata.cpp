/*! \class QSharedDataPointer
    \brief The QSharedDataPointer class provides a pointer to a shared data object.

    \reentrant
    \ingroup misc
    \mainclass

    QSharedDataPointer\<T\> makes it easier to write your own
    implicitly shared classes. It handles reference counting behind
    the scenes in a thread-safe manner, ensuring that classes that use
    it can be \l{reentrant}.

    Implicit sharing is used throughout Qt to combine the memory and
    speed efficiency of pointers with the ease of use of value types.
    See the \l{Shared Classes} page for more information.

    Let's suppose that you want to make an \c Employee class
    implicitly shared. The procedure is:

    \list
    \i Define the \c Employee class with a single data member variable of
       type QSharedDataPointer<\c{EmployeeData}>.
    \i Define an \c EmployeeData class that derives from \l QSharedData
       and that contains all the variables that you would normally
       put in \c Employee.
    \endlist

    To show how this works in practice, we will review the entire
    source code for an implicitly shared \c Employee class. Here's the
    header file that defines the \c Employee class:

    \include snippets/sharedemployee/employee.h

    All accesses to the data in the setter and getter functions are
    made through the QSharedDataPointer object \c d. For non-const
    functions, operator->() automatically calls detach(), ensuring
    that modifications to one \c Employee object don't affect other
    \c Employee objects.

    In this example, the \c EmployeeData type is a simple class with a
    default constructor and a copy constructor provided by C++. If
    member-per-member copy isn't sufficient for your own data type,
    you must implement your own copy constructor.

    Let's now see how to implement the \c Employee constructors:

    \quotefile snippets/sharedemployee/employee.cpp

    \skipto ::Employee()
    \printuntil }

    In the default constructor, we create an object of type
    \c EmployeeData and assign it to the \c d pointer using operator=().

    \skipto ::Employee(int
    \printuntil }

    In the constructor that takes an ID and an employee's name, we
    also create an object of type \c EmployeeData and assign it to the
    \c d pointer.

    In this example, we don't need to provide a copy constructor, an
    assignment operator, or a destructor for \c Employee. The default
    implementations provided by C++, which invoke QSharedDataPointer's
    copy constructor, assignment operator, or destructor, are
    sufficient. And this is true in general, i.e. for any QSharedData
    subclass which only stores values (or implicitly shared classes),
    such as int, double, QString, QStringList, QList\<QWidget*\>, and
    so on.

    Behind the scenes, QSharedDataPointer automatically increments or
    decrements the reference count of the shared data object pointed
    to by \c d, and deletes shared objects when the reference count
    reaches 0.
