Roadmap for Qt Database module

Basic Database Support
----------------------
Complete basic API. [done]
	 QSqlConnection - static methods to retrieve current database connection(s)
	 QSqlDatabase - interface to connect to SQL backends
	 QSql - interface to execute SQL queries (wraps QSqlResult)
	 QSqlError - for error reporting

	 QSqlViewBase - abstract base
	 QSqlView - info about SQL views
	 QSqlTable - into about SQL tables

	 QSqlDriver - abstract base for drivers (loaded by QSqlDatabase)
	 QSqlResult - abstract base for drivers (created by QSqlDriver)
	
Document basic API/abstraction. [not done]

Decide on list of supported backends.  Options: [* = my current choices]
	*MySQL
	*ODBC
	*PostgreSQL
	Berkeley DB
	DB2
	DiamondBase
	Empress
	Informix
	Ingres
	Interbase (Borland)
	Mimer
	MiniSQL (unix only?)
	MS SQL Server (windows only?)
	Oracle
	SOLID SQL Server
	Sybase 
	XML? (this would require our own SQL parser)
	Others...?

Decide on level of distribution 
	include database client libraries?
	load driver modules at runtime?

Make QVariant more SQL friendly [done]

Implement drivers: [partially done]
	Implement client-side cursors for drivers that need it (e.g., OCI, certain ODBC drivers)? [done]
	
Configure databases for testing 
	(this may be expensive/time-consuming)
	Oracle is running now on Windows and Linux.

Implement test programs/benchmarks/etc. This should include tests for:
	Proper result set scrolling [done]
	Proper inserts/updates/deletes [done]
	Proper data type conversions (including date/time and binary) [not done]
	

Extended Database Support
-------------------------
More database abstractions:
	QSqlFieldManager - map QObject* <=> QSqlField* for interaction with the GUI [not done]
	QSqlField - field info + the actual data [done]
	QSqlFieldList - multiple, related field information
	QSqlRowset - manipulate an entire row of SQL fields [done]
	QSqlView - map directly to a SQL table/view for inserts/updates/deletes, autonumbering primary keys? [done]

Design 'data aware' widgets.  Some ideas:
	QSqlDataGrid(s) - a QTable driven by a SQL query [partially done]
	QSqlComboBox - a QComboBox driven by a SQL query [not done]
	QSqlForm - a QDialog with database update capability (use QSqlTable?) (link easily to QDataGrid?) [not done]
	QSqlListBox - read-only SQL lookups [not done]
	QSqlListView - SQL browse/tree [not done]

Add Qt Designer support for the above [not done]
