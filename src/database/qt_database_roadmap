Roadmap for Qt Database module

Basic Database Support
----------------------
Complete basic API. [partially done]
	 QSqlDatabase - interface to connect to SQL backends
	 QSql - interface to execute SQL queries (wraps QSqlResult)
	 QSqlError - for error reporting
	 QSqlResultInfo - SQL query result info

	 QSqlViewBase - abstract base
	 QSqlView - info about SQL views
	 QSqlTable - into about SQL tables

	 QSqlDriver - abstract base for drivers (loaded by QSqlDatabase)
	 QSqlResult - abstract base for drivers (created by QSqlDriver)
	
Document basic API/abstraction. [partially done]

Decide on list of supported backends.  Options: [* = my current choices]
	Berkeley DB
	DB2
	DiamondBase
	Empress
	Informix
	Ingres
	Interbase (Borland)
	Mimer
	MiniSQL (unix only?)
	MS SQL Server (windows only?)
	*MySQL
	*ODBC
	Oracle
	*PostgreSQL
	SOLID SQL Server
	Sybase 
	XML? (this would require our own SQL parser)
	Others...?

Decide on level of distribution 
	include database client libraries?
	load driver modules at runtime?

Make QVariant more SQL friendly 

Implement drivers: [partially done]
	Implement client-side cursors for drivers that need it (e.g., OCI, certain ODBC drivers)?
	Transactions?
	
Configure databases for testing 
	(this may be expensive/time-consuming)

Implement test programs/benchmarks/etc. This should include tests for:
	Proper result set scrolling
	Proper inserts/updates/deletes
	Proper data type conversions (including date/time and binary)
	

Extended Database Support
-------------------------
Design more database abstractions: Some ideas:
	QSqlTransaction - SLQ transactions 
	QSqlField - field info + the actual data
	QSqlRecord - manipulate an entire row of SQL fields
	QSqlTable - map directly to a SQL table for inserts/updates/deletes, autonumbering primary keys?
	QSqlView - query a bunch of QSqlTables, syncronize them for updates, generate ANSI SQL automatically.
	QSqlCatalog - extended database information (tables, indexes, fields, etc)

Design 'data aware' widgets.  Some ideas:
	QSqlDataGrid - a QTable driven by a SQL query
	QSqlComboBox - a QComboBox driven by a SQL query
	QSqlForm - a QDialog with database update capability (use QSqlTable?) (link easily to QDataGrid?)
	QSqlListBox - read-only SQL lookups
	QSqlListView - SQL browse/tree

Implement the above

Add Qt Designer support for the above
