QPSQL
- add large object support in the driver only

All drivers
- ensure proper "primary index" support when generating field lists

QOCI
- must map to proper data types when defining fields!
- caching:  maybe implement a 'cache-to-disk' mechanism, otherwise big queries get way out of hand
- optimize fetchNext() - no need to keep asking for field info unless the query changes. duh.
- pull the caching code out of fetchNext() and stick it in reset() where it can be optimized better.  Then all the fetch*() methods are in-memory only.
- or... never cache anything until the first fetch() <= this will optimize copying QSql around before it is actually used.
- transaction support
- fix QOCIResultPrivate to use proper field size when creating memory

QODBC
- check out the easysoft Oracle ODBC driver, and see how useful it is

QSqlIndex
- Add ASC/DESC sorting
- add proper name support for each driver
- foreign indexes?  <= important for lookups
