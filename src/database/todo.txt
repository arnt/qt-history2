ODBC
- reimplement QODBCDriver::table() to use catalog functions which will make this method faster (and potentially more accurate).

OCI
- get proper datatype back when creating QSqlResultInfo

QVariant
- add binary support

QPSQL
- add large object support in the driver only

QSQL
- add QSqlRow to QSql to support insert, update, delete?  this may only make sense for tables...
