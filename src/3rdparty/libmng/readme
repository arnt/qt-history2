libmng v0.9.1
-------------

This is the second beta-release!

I have added an improved suspension-mode with this one.

Also the mng_read() and mng_display() functions now work
as one might expect. And the mng_display_freeze(),
mng_display_resume() and mng_display_reset() functions will
work in this scenario.

Other than that there are a few minor changes and bug-fixes
in the read & write logic. the file changes.readme contains
a full list.

This may be the last of the betas before the first real public
release finds its way to the net. The number of bug-reports on
v0.9.0 was low, which is very promising.
