libmng 1.0.3
------------

Third maintenance release!

Small cosmetic changes. Cleaning up the contributions.
New makefile for mingw32, and new fbcon example.
Major thanks to Greg for helping out with the *nix stuff!
Note that there's also a separate download for ASM programmers now.
Check http://www.libmng.com for details (download/ports&packages page).

It may be a while for the next release. I'm "off duty" for the next 8 or
so months...
