libmng 1.0.0
------------

The first public release. Finally(!)!

This is the 0.9.5 CVS version, which will never be released, because I feel it
is now ready for a public release. So apart from the version-numbers here and
there, all other changes are listed under 0.9.5.

This library will work with every MNG/JNG known and available to me. Note that
there are still parts that need to be coded, and that MNG support is around
90-95% (JNG at 100%). It is however compliant with the latest and greatest
MNG 1.0 specification.

I hope to dedicate a bit more time this year to finish up full support and fill
in the remaining blanks. But this is coming out of my spare time. And extra
help is always appreciated.

Please enjoy!

Gerard
