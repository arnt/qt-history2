This directory hosts the makefiles for all currently supported platforms.

Copy the module for your environment (or the closest thing) into the
libmng source-directory and change it to your needs. If you create a new
file for a platform not on the list send it to me (gerard @ libmng.com)
and I'll be happy to include it in the next release!


Current files:

makefile.bcb3 - Borland C++ Builder
makefile.unix - generic Unix
makefile.linux - Linux ELF (builds shared library)
