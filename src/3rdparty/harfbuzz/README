This is HarfBuzz, an OpenType Layout engine.

It was derived originally from the OpenType code in FreeType-1.x, ported to
FreeType2.  (This code has been abandoned for FreeType2, but until something
better comes along, should serve our purposes.) In addition to porting to
FreeType-2, it has been modified in various other ways.

It also includes a partial XML dumper for OpenType Layout tables useful for
figuring out what is going on. Please extend to cover additional parts of the
tables as you encounter fonts using them.  The dumper is written by Owen Taylor.

Bug reports on these files should be sent to the HarfBuzz mailing list as
listed on http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz
