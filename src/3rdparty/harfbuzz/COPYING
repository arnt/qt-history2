HarfBuzz is distributed under two mutually exclusive open-source licenses.
This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses  described
below, then obey  all its  terms and conditions when  using  HarfBuzz  in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License, found in the file `COPYING.FTL', which is similar to
    the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces you  to
    explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's documentation.
    All  details are in the license  file.  This license is  suited  to
    products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public License.

  - The GNU  General Public License  version 2, found in  `COPYING.GPL' (any
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the GPL.
    Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible with the  GPL due  to its
    advertisement clause.
