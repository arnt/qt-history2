Changes since the last public release (1.2.16):

version 1.2.17 [May 14, 2007]

  Revised scripts/CMakeLists.txt to install both shared and static libraries.
  Deleted a redundant line from pngset.c.
  Relocated misplaced test for png_ptr == NULL in pngpread.c
  Use "==" to "&" for testing PNG_RGB_TO_GRAY_ERR & PNG_RGB_TO_GRAY_WARN flags.
  Added pngerror() when write_IHDR fails in deflateInit2().
  Added "const" to some array declarations.
  Mention examples of libpng usage in the libpng*.txt and libpng.3 documents.
  Moved several PNG_HAVE_* macros out of PNG_INTERNAL because applications
    calling set_unknown_chunk_location() need them.
  Changed transformation flag from PNG_EXPAND_tRNS to PNG_EXPAND in
    png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8().
  Added png_ptr->unknown_chunk to hold working unknown chunk data, so it
    can be free'ed in case of error.  Revised unknown chunk handling in
    pngrutil.c and pngpread.c to use this structure.
  Revised symbol-handling in configure script.
  Added "png_ptr->num_trans=0" before error return in png_handle_tRNS,
    to eliminate a vulnerability (CVE-2007-2554, CERT VU#684664)
