/*! \class QReadWriteLock
    \brief The QReadWriteLock class provides read-write locking.

    \threadsafe

    \ingroup thread
    \ingroup environment

    A read-write lock is a synchronization tool for protecting
    resources that can be accessed for reading and writing. This type
    of lock is useful if you want to allow multiple threads to have
    simultaneous read-only access, but as soon as one thread wants to
    write to the resource, all other threads must be blocked until
    the writing is complete.

    In many cases, QReadWriteLock is a direct competitor to QMutex.
    QReadWriteLock is a good choice if there are many concurrent
    reads and writing occurs infrequently.

    Example:

    \code
        QReadWriteLock lock;

        void ReaderThread::run()
        {
            ...
            lock.lockForRead();
            read_file();
            lock.unlock();
            ...
        }

        void WriterThread::run()
        {
            ...
            lock.lockForWrite();
            write_file();
            lock.unlock();
            ...
        }
    \endcode

    To ensure that writers aren't blocked forever by readers, readers
    attempting to obtain a lock will not succeed if there is a blocked 
    writer waiting for access, even if the lock is currently only
    accessed by other readers. Also, if the lock is accessed by a
    writer and another writer comes in, that writer will have
    priority over any readers that might also be waiting.

    The purpose of QReadLock (and QWriteLock) is to simplify
    QReadWriteLock locking and unlocking. Locking and unlocking
    statements or in exception handling code is error-prone and
    difficult to debug. QReadLocker can be used in such situations
    to ensure that the state of the lock is always well-defined.

    Here's an example that uses QReadLocker to lock and unlock a
    read-write lock for reading:

    \code
        QReadWriteLock lock;

        QByteArray readData()
        {
            QReadLocker locker(&lock);
            ...
            return data;
        }
    \endcode

    It is equivalent to the following code:

    \code
        QReadWriteLock lock;

        QByteArray readData()
        {
            locker.lockForRead();
            ...
            locker.unlock();
            return data;
        }
    \endcode

    The QMutexLocker documentation shows examples where the use of a
    locker object greatly simplifies programming.
