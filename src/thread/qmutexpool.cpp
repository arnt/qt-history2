    \class QMutexPool qmutexpool_p.h
    \brief The QMutexPool class provides a pool of QMutex objects.

    \internal

    \ingroup thread

    QMutexPool is a convenience class that provides access to a fixed
    number of QMutex objects.

    Typical use of a QMutexPool is in situations where it is not
    possible or feasible to use one QMutex for every protected object.
    The mutex pool will return a mutex based on the address of the
    object that needs protection.

    For example, consider this simple class:

    \code
    class Number {
    public:
	Number(double n) : num (n) { }

	void setNumber(double n) { num = n; }
	double number() const { return num; }

    private:
	double num;
    };
    \endcode

    Adding a QMutex member to the Number class does not make sense,
    because it is so small. However, in order to ensure that access to
    each Number is protected, you need to use a mutex. In this case, a
    QMutexPool would be ideal.

    Code to calculate the square of a number would then look something
    like this:

    \code
    void calcSquare(Number *num)
    {
	QMutexLocker locker(mutexpool.get(num));
	num.setNumber(num.number() * num.number());
    }
    \endcode

    This function will safely calculate the square of a number, since
    it uses a mutex from a QMutexPool. The mutex is locked and
    unlocked automatically by the QMutexLocker class. See the
    QMutexLocker documentation for more details.
