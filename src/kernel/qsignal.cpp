  \class QSignal qsignal.h
  \brief The QSignal class can be used to send signals without parameters.

  \ingroup kernel

  QSignal is a simple extension of QObject that can send plain signals
  without parameters.  If you want to send signals from a class that does
  not inherit QObject, you can create an internal QSignal object to emit
  the signal. You must also provide a function that connects the signal to
  an outside object slot.  This is how we have implemented signals in the
  QMenuData class, which is not a QObject.

  In general, we recommend inheriting QObject instead.	QObject provides
  much more functionality.

  Note that QObject is a \e private base class of QSignal, i.e. you cannot
  call any QObject member functions from a QSignal object.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qsignal.h>

    class MyClass
    {
    public:
	MyClass();
       ~MyClass();

	void doSomething();

	void connect( QObject *receiver, const char *member );

    private:
	QSignal *sig;
    };

    MyClass::MyClass()
    {
	sig = new QSignal;
    }

    MyClass::~MyClass()
    {
	delete sig;
    }

    void MyClass::doSomething()
    {
	// ... does something
	sig->activate();	// activates the signal
    }

    void MyClass::connect( QObject *receiver, const char *member )
    {
	sig->connect( receiver, member );
    }
  \endcode
