  \class QFrameBuffer qframebuffer.h
  \brief The QFrameBuffer class is similar to QImage, only faster and more low-level.

  \ingroup kernel

  A frame buffer is very similar to an \link QImage image\endlink, but
  optimized for drawing speed and not ease of programming.  A frame buffer
  can be thought of as a \link QPixmap pixmap\endlink where you can access
  the pixel data directly.  QFrameBuffer is ideal for high-performance
  graphics, for example action games and real-time image rendering where
  QImage turns out to be too slow.

  The low-level nature of QFrameBuffer makes it more cumbersome to use for
  the programmer than QImage.  While QImage offers 3 bit depths only (1, 8
  and 32 bpp), QFrameBuffer gives you whatever the underlying hardware
  offers.

  To draw the contents of a frame buffer on a \link QWidget widget\endlink
  or a pixmap, simply use the \l bitBlt function.
