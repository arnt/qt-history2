/*!
  \class QEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QEvent class is base class of all
  event classes. Event objects contain event parameters.

  \ingroup event
  \ingroup kernel

  The \link QApplication::exec() main event loop\endlink of Qt fetches
  native window system events from the event queue, translates them
  into QEvent and sends the translated events to QObjects.

  Generally, events come from the underlying window system, but it is
  also possible to manually send events through the QApplication class
  using QApplication::sendEvent() and QApplication::postEvent().

  QObject received events by having its QObject::event() function
  called.  The default implementation simply calls
  QObject::timerEvent() for timer events and ignores all other events.
  QWidget reimplements \link QWidget::event() event() \endlink and
  dispatches incoming events to various event handles such as
  QWidget::keyPressEvent() and QWidget::mouseMoveEvent().

  The basic QEvent only contains an event type parameter.  Subclasses
  of QEvent contain additional parameters that describe the particular
  event.

  QApplication::sendEvent() QAppilcation::postEvent()

/*! \enum Qt::ButtonState
  This enum type describes the state of the mouse buttons, with
  associated shift buttons.  The currently defined values are:<ul>

  <li> \c NoButton - used when the button state does not refer to any
  button (see QMouseEvent::button()).

  <li> \c LeftButton - set if the left button is pressed, or this
  event refers to the left button.  Note that the left button may be
  the right button on left-handed mice.

  <li> \c RightButton - the right button.

  <li> \c MidButton - the middle button

  <li> \c ShiftButton - a shift key on the keyboard is also pressed.

  <li> \c ControlButton - a control key on the keyboard is also pressed.

  <li> \c AltButton - an alt (or meta) key on the keyboard is also pressed.

  \class QTimerEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QTimerEvent class contains parameters that describe a
  timer event.

  \ingroup event


  Timer events are sent at regular intervals to objects that have
  started one or more timers.  Each timer has a unique identifier.

  If interval is 0, then the timer event occurs
  once every time there are no more window system events to process.

  The QTimer class provides a high-level programming interface with one-shot
  timers and timer signals instead of events.

  The event handler QObject::timerEvent() receives timer events.

/*!
  \class QMouseEvent qevent.h

  \brief The QMouseEvent class contains parameters that describe a mouse event.

  \ingroup event


  Mouse events occur when a mouse button is pressed or released inside a
  widget, or when the mouse cursor is moved.

  Mouse move events will only occur when some mouse button is pressed down,
  unless \link QWidget::setMouseTracking() mouse tracking\endlink has been
  enabled.

  Qt makes an automatic mouse grab when a mouse button is pressed inside a
  widget, and the widget will continue to receive mouse events until the
  last mouse button is released.

  The QWidget::setEnable() function can be used to enable or disable mouse
  and keyboard events for a widget.

  The QCursor widget has static functions for reading and setting the
  position of the mouse cursor.

  The event handlers QWidget::mousePressEvent(), QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent(),
  QWidget::mouseDoubleClickEvent() and QWidget::mouseMoveEvent() receive
  mouse events.

  \class QWheelEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QWheelEvent class contains parameters that describe a wheel event.

  \ingroup event


  Wheel events occur when a mouse wheel is turned while the widget has
  focus.  The rotation distance is provided by delta(). If required,
  both pos() and globalPos() return the mouse pointer location at the
  time of the event.

  A wheel event contains a special accept flag which tells whether the
  receiver wants the event.  You should call QWheelEvent::accept() if you
  handle the wheel event, otherwise it will be sent to the parent widget as well.

  The QWidget::setEnable() function can be used to enable or disable mouse
  and keyboard events for a widget.

  Returns the distance that the wheel is rotated, expressed in
  multiples or divisions of WHEEL_DELTA, which is set at 120
  currently.A positive value indicates that the wheel was rotated
  forward, away from the user; a negative value indicates that the
  wheel was rotated backward, toward the user.

  The WHEEL_DELTA constant was set to 120 by the wheel mouse vendors
  to allow building finer-resolution wheels in the future, including
  perhaps a freely-rotating wheel with no notches. The expectation is
  that such a device would send more messages per rotation, but with a
  smaller value in each message.

/*!
  \class QCloseEvent qevent.h
  \brief The QCloseEvent class contains parameters that describe a close event.

  \ingroup event

  Close events are sent to widgets that the user wants to close, usually
  by choosing "Close" from the window menu. They are also sent when you
  call QWidget::close() to close a widget from inside the program.

  Close events contain a special accept flag which tells whether the
  receiver wants the widget to be closed.  When a widget accepts the
  close event, it is hidden. If it refuses to accept the close event,
  either nothing happens or it is forcibly closed, if the sender of
  the close event really wants to.

  The main widget of the application - QApplication::mainWidget() - is
  a special case. When it accepts the close event, Qt leaves the main
  event loop and the application is immediately terminated (i.e. it
  returns back from the call to QApplication::exec() in your main()
  function).

  The event handler QWidget::closeEvent() receives close events.  The
  default implementation of this event handler accepts the close
  event.  If you do not want your widget to be hidden, or want some
  special handing, you need to reimplement the event handler.
  
  The <a href="simple-application.html#closeEvent">closeEvent() in the
  Application Walkthrough</a> shows a close event handler that asks
  whether to save the document before closing.

  If you want your widget also to be deleted when it is closed, simply
  create it with the \c WDestructiveClose widget flag.  This is very
  useful for the independent top-level windows of a multi window
  application. The Application Walkthrough example uses this too.

  QObject emits the \link QObject::destroyed() destroyed()\endlink signal
  when it is deleted.  This is a useful signal if a widget needs to know
  when another widget is deleted.

  If the last toplevel window is closed, the
  QApplication::lastWindowClosed() signal is emitted.

  Sets the action.  This is used internally, you should not need to
  call this in your code - the \e source decides the action, not the
  target.
*/

/*!
  \enum QDropEvent::Action

  This type describes the action which a source requests that a target
  perform with dropped data.  The values are:

  <ul>
   <li>\c Copy - the default action.  The source simply users the data
	    provided in the operation.
   <li>\c Link. The source should somehow create a link to the location
	    specified by the data.
   <li>\c Move.  The source should somehow move the object from the location
	    specified by the data to a new location.
   <li>\c Private.  The target has special knowledge of the MIME type, which
	    the source should respond to similar to a Copy.
   <li>\c UserAction.  The source and target can co-operate using special
	    actions.  This feature is not supported in Qt at this time.
  </ul>

  The Link and Move actions only makes sense if the data is

  \brief The event sent to widgets when a drag-and-drop first drags onto it.

  This event is always immediate followed by a QDragMoveEvent, thus you need
  only respond to one or the other event.  Note that this class inherits most
  of its functionality from QDragMoveEvent, which in turn inherits most
  of its functionality from QDropEvent.

  window system and internal show events. Spontaneous show events are
  sent just after the window system shows the window, including after
  a top-level window has been shown (un-iconified) by the
  user. Internal show events are delivered just before the widget
  becomes visible.
