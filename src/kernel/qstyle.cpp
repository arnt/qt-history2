/*!
  \class QStyle qstyle.h
  \brief The QStyle class specifies the look and feel of a GUI.
  \preliminary
  \ingroup appearance

  Although it is not possible to fully enumerate the look of graphic elements
  and the feel of widgets in a GUI, a large number of elements are common
  to many widgets.  The QStyle class allows the look of these elements to
  be modified across all widgets that use the QStyle functions.  It also
  provides two feel options: Motif and Windows.

  In Qt 1.x the look and feel option for widgets was specified by a
  single value - the GUIStyle.  Starting with Qt 2.0, this notion has
  been expanded to allow the look to be specified by virtual drawing
  functions.

  Derived classes may reimplement some or all of the drawing functions
  to modify the look of all widgets that use those functions.

  Languages written from right to left (as hebrew and arabic) usually
  also mirror the whole layout of widgets. If you design a style, you should
  take special care when drawing asymmetric elements to make sure
  they also look correct for a mirrored layout. You can start your application
  with -reverse to check the mirrored layout. Also notice, that for a reversed
  layout, the light usually comes from top right instead of top left.

/*! \enum QStyle::ScrollControl
  This enum type defines
  \value AddLine  control to scroll one line down, usually an arrow button
  \value SubLine  control to scroll one line up, usually an arrow button
  \value AddPage  control to scroll one page down
  \value SubPage  control to scroll one page up
  \value First  control to scroll to top of the range
  \value Last  control to scroll to bottom of the range
  \value Slider  the slider control
  \value NoScroll  null value, indicates none of the visible controls

/*!
  Initializes the appearance of a widget.

  This function is called for every widget at some point after it has
  been fully created but just \e before it is shown the very first
  time.

  Reasonable actions in this function might be to call
  QWidget::setBackgroundMode for the widget. An example of highly
  unreasonable use would be setting the geometry!

  The QWidget::inherits() function may provide enough information to
  allow class-specific customizations.  But be careful not to hard-code
  things too much because new QStyle subclasses will be expected to work
  reasonably with all current \e and \e future widgets.
