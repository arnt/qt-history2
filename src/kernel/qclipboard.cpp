    \class QClipboard qclipboard.h
    \brief The QClipboard class provides access to the window system clipboard.

    \ingroup io
    \ingroup environment
    \mainclass

    The clipboard offers a simple mechanism to copy and paste data
    between applications.

    QClipboard supports the same data types that QDragObject does, and
    uses similar mechanisms. For advanced clipboard usage
    read \link dnd.html the drag-and-drop documentation\endlink.

    There is a single QClipboard object in an application, and you can
    access it using QApplication::clipboard().

    Example:
    \code
    QClipboard *cb = QApplication::clipboard();
    QString text;

    // Copy text from the clipboard (paste)
    text = cb->text();
    if ( text )
	qDebug( "The clipboard contains: %s", text );

    // Copy text into the clipboard
    cb->setText( "This text can be pasted by other programs" );
    \endcode

    QClipboard features some convenience functions to access common data
    types: setText() allows the exchange of Unicode text and
    setPixmap() and setImage() allows the exchange of QPixmaps
    and QImages between applications. The setData() function is the
    ultimate in flexibility: it allows you to add any QMimeSource into the
    clipboard. There are corresponding getters for each of these, e.g.
    text(), image() and pixmap().

    You can clear the clipboard by calling clear().

    The underlying clipboards of the X Window system and MS Windows
    differ. The X Window system has a concept of selection -- when text
    is selected, it is immediately available in the selection buffer; MS
    Windows only adds text to the clipboard when an explicit copy or cut
    is made. The X Window system also has a concept of ownership; if you
    change the selection within a window, X11 will only notify the owner
    and the previous owner of the change; in MS Windows the clipboard is
    a fully global resource so all applications are notified of changes.
    See the multiclip example in the \e{Qt Designer} examples
    directory for an example of a multiplatform clipboard application
    that also demonstrates selection handling.

    Constructs a clipboard object.

    Do not call this function.

    Call QApplication::clipboard() instead to get a pointer to the
    application's global clipboard object.

    There is only one clipboard in the window system, and creating
    more than one object to represent it is almost certainly an error.
