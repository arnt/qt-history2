  The color dictionary speeds up color allocation significantly for X11.

  flag to FALSE and try to find the nearest color.
  NOTE: From deep within the event loop, the colors_avail flag is reset to
  TRUE (calls the function qt_reset_color_avail()), because some other
  application might free its colors, thereby making them available for
  this Qt application.

  Allocates the RGB color and returns the pixel value.

  Allocating a color means to obtain a pixel value from the RGB
  specification.  The pixel value is an index into the global color
  table, but should be considered an arbitrary platform-dependent value.

  The pixel() function calls alloc() if necessary, so in general you
  don't need to call this function.

/*!
  Enters a color allocation context and returns a nonzero unique identifier.

  Color allocation contexts are useful for programs that need to
  allocate many colors and throw them away later, like image viewers.
  The allocation context functions work for true color displays as
  well as colormap display, except that QColor::destroyAllocContext()
  does nothing for true color.

  Example:
  \code
    QPixmap loadPixmap( QString fileName )
    {
	static int alloc_context = 0;
	if ( alloc_context )
	    QColor::destroyAllocContext( alloc_context );
	alloc_context = QColor::enterAllocContext();
	QPixmap pm( fileName );
	QColor::leaveAllocContext();
	return pm;
    }
  \endcode

  The example code loads a pixmap from file. It frees up all colors
  that were allocated the last time loadPixmap() was called.

  The initial/default context is 0. Qt keeps a list of colors
  associated with their allocation contexts. You can call
  destroyAllocContext() to get rid of all colors that were allocated
  in a specific context.

  Calling enterAllocContext() enters an allocation context. The
  allocation context lasts until you call leaveAllocContext(). QColor
  has an internal stack of allocation contexts. Each call to
  enterAllocContex() must have a corresponding leaveAllocContext().

  \code
      // context 0 active
    int c1 = QColor::enterAllocContext();	// enter context c1
      // context c1 active
    int c2 = QColor::enterAllocContext();	// enter context c2
      // context c2 active
    QColor::leaveAllocContext();		// leave context c2
      // context c1 active
    QColor::leaveAllocContext();		// leave context c1
      // context 0 active
      // Now, free all colors that were allocated in context c2
    QColor::destroyAllocContext( c2 );
  \endcode

  You may also want to set the application's color specification.
  See QApplication::setColorSpec() for more information.

  \sa leaveAllocContext(), currentAllocContext(), destroyAllocContext(),
  QApplication::setColorSpec()

{
    return 1;

/*!

void QColor::leaveAllocContext()
{
}
