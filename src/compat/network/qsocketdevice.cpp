    \class QSocketDevice
    \brief The QSocketDevice class provides a platform-independent low-level socket API.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">Qt Enterprise Edition</a>.
\endif

    \ingroup io
    \module network

    QSocketDevice provides a low level API for working with sockets.
    Users of this class are assumed to have networking experience.
    For most users, the QSocket class provides a much easier and high
    level alternative, but certain things (like UDP) cannot be done
    with QSocket and if you need a platform-independent API for those,
    QSocketDevice is the right choice.

    The essential purpose of the class is to provide a QIODevice that
    works on sockets, wrapped in a platform-independent API.

    When calling connect() or bind(), QSocketDevice detects the
    protocol family (IPv4, IPv6) automatically. Passing the protocol
    family to QSocketDevice's constructor or to setSocket() forces
    creation of a socket device of a specific protocol. If not set, the
    protocol will be detected at the first call to connect() or bind().

/*!
    \enum QSocketDevice::Protocol

    This enum type describes the protocol family of the socket. Possible
    values are:

    \value IPv4 The socket is an IPv4 socket.
    \value IPv6 The socket is an IPv6 socket.
    \value Unknown The protocol family of the socket is not known. This can
           happen if you use QSocketDevice with an already existing socket; it
           tries to determine the protocol family, but this can fail if the
           protocol family is not known to QSocketDevice.

    \sa protocol() setSocket()

/*!
    \enum QSocketDevice::Error

    This enum type describes the error states of QSocketDevice.

    \value NoError        No error occurred.

    \value AlreadyBound   The device is already bound, according to bind().

    \value Inaccessible   The operating system or firewall prohibited
                          the action.

    \value NoResources    The operating system ran out of a resource.

    \value InternalError  An internal error occurred in QSocketDevice.

    \value Impossible     An attempt was made to do something which makes
    no sense. For example:
    \code
    ::close(sd->socket());
    sd->writeBlock(someData, 42);
    \endcode
    The libc ::close() closes the socket, but QSocketDevice is not aware
    of this. So when you call writeBlock(), it attempts to do the
    impossible.

    \value NoFiles        The operating system will not let QSocketDevice
                          open another file.

    \value ConnectionRefused  A connection attempt was rejected by the peer.

    \value NetworkFailure  There is a network failure.

    \value UnknownError    The operating system did something unexpected.
