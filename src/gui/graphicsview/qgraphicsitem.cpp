    \class QGraphicsItem
    \brief The QGraphicsItem class is the base class for all graphical
    items in a QGraphicsScene.
    \since 4.2
    \ingroup multimedia

    It provides a light-weight foundation for writing your own custom items.
    This includes defining the item's geometry, collision detection, its
    painting implementation and item interaction through its event handlers.
    QGraphicsItem is part of \l{The Graphics View Framework}

    \img graphicsview-items.png

    For convenience, Qt provides a set of standard graphics items for the most
    common shapes. These are:

    \list
    \o QGraphicsEllipseItem provides an ellipse item
    \o QGraphicsLineItem provides a line item
    \o QGraphicsPathItem provides an arbitrary path item
    \o QGraphicsPixmapItem provides a pixmap item
    \o QGraphicsPolygonItem provides a polygon item
    \o QGraphicsRectItem provides a rectangular item
    \o QGraphicsTextItem provides a text item
    \endlist

    All of an item's geometric information is based on its local coordinate
    system. The item's position, pos(), is the only function that does not
    operate in local coordinates, as it returns a position in parent
    coordinates. {The Graphics View Coordinate System} describes the coordinate
    system in detail.

    You can set whether an item should be visible (i.e., drawn, and accepting
    events), by calling setVisible(). Hiding an item will also hide its
    children. Similarily, you can enable or disable an item by calling
    setEnabled(). If you disable an item, all its children will also be
    disabled. By default, items are both visible and enabled. To toggle
    whether an item is selected or not, first enable selection by setting
    the ItemIsSelectable flag, and then call setSelected(). Normally,
    selection is toggled by the scene, as a result of user interaction.

    To write your own graphics item, you first create a subclass of
    QGraphicsItem, and then start by implementing its two pure virtual public
    functions: boundingRect(), which returns an estimate of the area painted
    by the item, and paint(), which implements the actual painting. For
    example:

    \code
        class SimpleItem : public QGraphicsItem
        {
        public:
            QRectF boundingRect() const
            {
                qreal penWidth = 1;
                return QRectF(-10 - penWidth / 2, -10 - penWidth / 2,
                              20 + penWidth / 2, 20 + penWidth / 2);
            }

            void paint(QPainter *painter, const QStyleOptionGraphicsItem *option,
                       QWidget *widget)
            {
                painter->drawRoundRect(-10, -10, 20, 20);
            }
        };
    \endcode

    The boundingRect() function has many different purposes. QGraphicsScene
    bases its item index on boundingRect(), and QGraphicsView uses it both for
    culling invisible items, and for determining the area that needs to be
    recomposed when drawing overlapping items. In addition, QGraphicsItem's
    collision detection mechanisms use boundingRect() to provide an efficient
    cut-off. The fine grained collision algorithm in collidesWithItem() is based
    on calling shape(), which returns an accurate outline of the item's shape
    as a QPainterPath.

    Collision detection can be done in two ways:

    \list 1

    \o Reimplement shape() to return an accurate shape for your item, and rely
    on the default implementation of collidesWithItem() to do shape-shape
    intersection. This can be rather expensive if the shapes are complex.

    \o Reimplement collidesWithItem() to provide your own custom item and shape
    collision algorithm.

    \endlist

    The contains() function can be called to determine whether the item \e
    contains a point or not. This function can also be reimplemented by the
    item. The default behavior of contains() is based on calling shape().

    Items can contain other items, and also be contained by other items. All
    items can have a parent item and a list of children. Unless the item has
    no parent, its position is in \e parent coordinates (i.e., the parent's
    local coordinates). Parent items propagate both their position and their
    transformation to all children.

    \img graphicsview-parentchild.png

    QGraphicsItem supports affine transformations in addition to its base
    position, pos(). To change the item's transformation, you can either pass
    a transformation matrix to setMatrix(), or call one of the convenience
    functions rotate(), scale(), translate(), or shear(). Item transformations
    accumulate from parent to child, so if both a parent and child item are
    rotated 90 degrees, the child's total transformation will be 180 degrees.
    Similarily, if the item's parent is scaled to 2x its original size, its
    children will also be twice as large. An item's transformation does not
    affect its own local geometry; all geometry functions (e.g., contains(),
    update(), and all the mapping functions) still operate in local
    coordinates. For convenience, QGraphicsItem provides the functions
    sceneMatrix(), which returns the item's total transformation matrix
    (including its position and all parents' positions and transformations),
    and scenePos(), which returns its position in scene coordinates. To reset
    an item's matrix, call resetMatrix().

    The paint() function is called by QGraphicsView to paint the item's
    contents. The item has no background or default fill of its own; whatever
    is behind the item will shine through all areas that are not explicitly
    painted in this function.  You can call update() to schedule a repaint,
    optionally passing the rectangle that needs a repaint. Depending on
    whether or not the item is visible in a view, the item may or may not be
    repainted; there is no equivalent to QWidget::repaint() in QGraphicsItem.

    Items are painted by the view, starting with the parent items and then
    drawing children, in ascending stacking order. You can set an item's
    stacking order by calling setZValue(), and test it by calling
    zValue(), where items with low z-values are painted before items with
    high z-values. Stacking order applies to sibling items; parents are always
    drawn before their children.

    QGraphicsItem receives events from QGraphicsScene through the virtual
    function sceneEvent(). This function distributes the most common events
    to a set of convenience event handlers:

    \list
    \o contextMenuEvent() handles context menu events
    \o focusInEvent() and focusOutEvent() handle focus in and out events
    \o hoverEnterEvent(), hoverMoveEvent(), and hoverLeaveEvent() handles
    hover enter, move and leave events
    \o inputMethodEvent() handles input events, for accessibility support
    \o keyPressEvent() and keyReleaseEvent handle key press and release events
    \o mousePressEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(), mouseReleaseEvent(), and
    mouseDoubleClickEvent() handles mouse press, move, release, click and
    doubleclick events
    \endlist

    You can filter events for any other item by installing event
    filters. This functionaly is separate from from Qt's regular
    event filters (see QObject::installEventFilter()), which only
    work on subclasses of QObject. After installing your item as an
    event filter for another item by calling
    installSceneEventFilter(), the filtered events will be received
    by the virtual function sceneEventFilter(). You can remove item
    event filters by calling removeSceneEventFilter().

    Sometimes it's useful to register custom data with an item, be it a custom
    item, or a standard item. You can call setData() on any item to store data
    in it using a key-value pair (the key being an integer, and the value is a
    QVariant). To get custom data from an item, call data(). This
    functionality is completely untouched by Qt itself; it is provided for the
    user's convenience.

    \sa QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsView, {The Graphics View Framework}
*/

/*!
    \variable QGraphicsItem::UserType

    The lowest permitted type value for custom items (subclasses
    of QGraphicsItem or any of the standard items). This value is
    used in conjunction with a reimplementation of QGraphicsItem::type()
    and declaring a Type enum value. Example:

    \code
        class CustomItem : public QGraphicsItem
        {
           ...
           enum { Type = UserType + 1 }

           int type() const
           {
               // Enable the use of qgraphicsitem_cast with this item.
               return Type;
           }
           ...
        };
    \endcode
*/

/*!
    \enum QGraphicsItem::GraphicsItemFlag

    This enum describes different flags that you can set on an item to
    toggle different features in the item's behavior.

    All flags are disabled by default.

    \value ItemIsMovable The item supports interactive movement using
    the mouse. By clicking on the item and then dragging, the item
    will move together with the mouse cursor. If the item has
    children, all children are also moved. If the item is part of a
    selection, all selected items are also moved. This feature is
    provided as a convenience through the base implementation of
    QGraphicsItem's mouse event handlers.

    \value ItemIsSelectable The item supports selection. Enabling this
    feature will enable setSelected() to toggle selection for the
    item. It will also let the item be selected automatically as a
    result of calling QGraphicsScene::setSelectionArea(), by clicking
    on an item, or by using rubber band selection in QGraphicsView.

    \value ItemIsFocusable The item supports keyboard input focus (i.e., it is
    an input item). Enabling this flag will allow the item to accept focus,
    which again allows the delivery of key events to
    QGraphicsItem::keyPressEvent() and QGraphicsItem::keyReleaseEvent().
*/

/*!
    \enum QGraphicsItem::GraphicsItemChange

    This enum describes the state changes that are notified by
    QGraphicsItem::itemChange(). The notifications are sent as the state
    changes, and in some cases, adjustments can be made (see the documentation
    for each change for details).

    Note: Be careful with calling functions on the QGraphicsItem itself inside
    itemChange(), as certain function calls can lead to unwanted
    recursion. For example, you cannot call setPos() in itemChange() on an
    ItemPositionChange notification, as the setPos() function will again call
    itemChange(ItemPositionChange). Instead, you can return the new, adjusted
    position from itemChange().

    \value ItemEnabledChange The item's enabled state changes. If the item is
    presently enabled, it will become disabled, and vice verca. The value
    argument is the new enabled state (i.e., true or false). Do not call
    setEnabled() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered. Instead,
    you can return the new state from itemChange().

    \value ItemMatrixChange The item's matrix changes. This notification is
    only sent when the item's local matrix changes (i.e., as a result of
    calling setMatrix(), or one of the convenience transformation functions,
    such as rotate()). The value argument is the new matrix (i.e., a QMatrix);
    to get the old matrix, call matrix(). Do not call setMatrix() or any of
    the transformation convenience functions in itemChange() as this
    notification is delivered; instead, you can return the new matrix from
    itemChange().

    \value ItemPositionChange The item's position changes. This notification
    is only sent when the item's local position changes, relative to its
    parent, has changed (i.e., as a result of calling setPos() or
    moveBy()). The value argument is the new position (i.e., a QPointF).
    You can call pos() to get the original position. Do not call setPos() or
    moveBy() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered; instead, you
    can return the new, adjusted position from itemChange().

    \value ItemSelectedChange The item's selected state changes. If the item
    is presently selected, it will become unselected, and vice verca. The
    value argument is the new selected state (i.e., true or false). Do not
    call setSelected() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered();
    instead, you can return the new selected state from itemChange().

    \value ItemVisibleChange The item's visible state changes. If the item is
    presently visible, it will become invisible, and vice verca. The value
    argument is the new visible state (i.e., true or false). Do not call
    setVisible() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered; instead,
    you can return the new visible state from itemChange().

    \value ItemParentChange The item's parent changes. The value argument is
    the new parent item (i.e., a QGraphicsItem pointer).  Do not call
    setParentItem() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered;
    instead, you can return the new parent from itemChange().

    \value ItemChildAddedChange A child is added to this item. The value
    argument is the new child item (i.e., a QGraphicsItem pointer). Do not
    pass this item to any item's setParentItem() function as this notification
    is delivered. The return value is unused; you cannot adjust anything in
    this notification.

    \value ItemChildRemovedChange A child is removed from this item. The value
    argument is the child item that is about to be removed (i.e., a
    QGraphicsItem pointer). The return value is unused; you cannot adjust
    anything in this notification.

    Note: For shapes that paint an outline / stroke, it is important
    to include half the pen width in the bounding rect. It is not
    necessary to compensate for antialiasing, though.

    To set the item's ellipse, pass a QRectF to QGraphicsEllipseItem's

    current ellipse geometry.

    QGraphicsEllipseItem uses the rect and the pen width to provide a
    reasonable implementation of boundingRect(), shape(), and contains(). The
    paint() function draws the ellipse using the item's associated pen and
    brush, which you can set by calling setPen() and setBrush().

    setTransformationMode(). By default, Qt::FastTransformation is
    used, which provides fast, non-smooth scaling. Call
    transformationMode() to get the current transformation mode for
    the item.

    \enum QGraphicsPixmapItem::ShapeMode

    This enum describes how QGraphicsPixmapItem calculates its shape.

    The default value is MaskShape.

    \value MaskShape The shape is determined by calling QPixmap::mask().
    This shape includes only the opaque pixels of the pixmap.
    Because the shape is more complex, however, it can be slower than the other modes,
    and uses more memory.

    \value BoundingRectShape The shape is determined by tracing the outline of
    the pixmap. This is the fastest shape mode, but it does not take into account
    any transparent areas on the pixmap.

    \value HeuristicMaskShape The shape is determine by calling
    QPixmap::createHeuristicMask().  The performance and memory consumption
    is similar to MaskShape.

    \brief The QGraphicsTextItem class provides a text item that you can add to
    a QGraphicsScene to display formatted text.
    \since 4.2
    \ingroup multimedia

    To set the item's text, pass a QString to QGraphicsTextItem's
    constructor, or call setHtml()/setPlainText().

    QGraphicsTextItem uses the text's formatted size and the associated font
    to provide a reasonable implementation of boundingRect(), shape(),
    and contains(). You can set the font by calling setFont().

    It is possible to make the item editable by setting the Qt::TextEditable flag
    using setTextInteractionFlags().

    \class QGraphicsItemGroup
    \brief The QGraphicsItemGroup class provides treating a group of items as
    one.
    \since 4.2
    \ingroup multimedia

    A QGraphicsItemGroup is a special type of compound item that
    treats itself and all its children as one item (i.e., all events
    and geometries for all children are merged together). It's common
    to use item groups in presentation tools, when the user wants to
    group several smaller items into one big item in order to simplify
    moving and copying of items.

    If all you want is to store items inside other items, you can use
    any QGraphicsItem directly by passing a suitable parent to
    setParentItem().

    The boundingRect() function of QGraphicsItemGroup returns the
    bounding rectangle of all items in the item group. In addition,
    item groups have handlesChildEvents() enabled by default, so all
    events sent to a member of the group go to the item group (i.e.,
    selecting one item in a group will select them all).

    There are two ways to construct an item group. The easiest and
    most common approach is to pass a list of items (e.g., all
    selected items) to QGraphicsScene::createItemGroup(), which
    returns a new QGraphicsItemGroup item. The other approach is to
    manually construct a QGraphicsItemGroup item, add it to the scene
    calling QGraphicsScene::addItem(), and then add items to the group
    manually, one at a time by calling addToGroup(). To dismantle
    ("ungroup") an item group, you can either call
    QGraphicsScene::destroyItemGroup(), or you can manually remove all
    items from the group by calling removeFromGroup().

    \code
      // Group all selected items together
      QGraphicsItemGroup *group = scene->createItemGroup(scene->selecteditems());

      // Destroy the group, and delete the group item
      scene->destroyItemGroup(group);
    \endcode

    The operation of adding and removing items preserves the items'
    scene-relative position and transformation, as opposed to calling
    setParentItem(), where only the child item's parent-relative
    position and transformation are kept.

    The addtoGroup() function reparents the target item to this item
    group, keeping the item's position and transformation intact
    relative to the scene. Visually, this means that items added via
    addToGroup() will remain completely unchanged as a result of this
    operation, regardless of the item or the group's current position
    or transformation; although the item's position and matrix are
    likely to change.

    The removeFromGroup() function has similar semantics to
    setParentItem(); it reparents the item to the parent item of the
    item group. As with addToGroup(), the item's scene-relative
    position and transformation remain intact.
