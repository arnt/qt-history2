    \class Q3Painter q3painter.h

    \brief Q3Painter is the compat version of QPainter.

    Prior to Qt 4, QPainter specialized the pen drawing for rectangle
    based functions (in particular: drawRect, drawEllipse,
    drawRoundRect, drawArc, drawChord and drawPie). When stroking a
    rectangle of width 10, the pen would draw a rectangle of width 10.
    Drawing a polygon defined by the corner points of the same
    rectangle the stroke would have a width of 11.

    The reason for this is best explained using the picture below:

    \img q3painter_rationale.png

    As we can see, stroking the rectangle so it gets a width of 10,
    means the pen is drawn on a rectangle on width 9. The polygon,
    however follows a consistent model.

    In Qt 4, all rectangle based functions have changed to follow the
    polygon approach, which means that the rectangle defines the size of
    the fill, and the pen follows the edges of the shape. For pen widths
    of 0 and 1 this means that the stroke will be inside the shape on the
    left and the top and outside on the bottom and right.

    The reason for the change in Qt 4 is so that we provide consistency
    for all drawing functions even with complex transformations.

    has a size of r.size() plus the pen width.

    \fn Q3Painter::drawEllipse(const QRect &r)

    Draws the ellipse that fits inside the rectangle \a r.

    A filled ellipse has a size of r.size(). An stroked ellipse
    has a size of r.size() plus the pen width.

/*!
    Q3Painter::drawPie(const QRect &r, int a, int alen)

    Draws a pie defined by the rectangle \a r, the start angle \a a
    and the arc length \a alen.

    The pie is filled with the current brush().

    The angles \a a and \a alen are 1/16th of a degree, i.e. a full
    circle equals 5760 (16*360). Positive values of \a a and \a alen
    mean counter-clockwise while negative values mean the clockwise
    direction. Zero degrees is at the 3 o'clock position.

    Draws the arc that fits inside the rectangle (\a{x}, \a{y}, \a{w},
    \a{h}), with the given \a startAngle and \a spanAngle.
*/

/*!
    \fn void Q3Painter::drawArc(const QRect &r, int a, int alen)

    Draws an arc defined by the rectangle \a r, the start angle \a a
    and the arc length \a alen.

    The angles \a a and \a alen are 1/16th of a degree, i.e. a full

    mean counter-clockwise while negative values mean the clockwise
    direction. Zero degrees is at the 3 o'clock position.

    Example:
    \code
        QPainter p(myWidget);
        p.drawArc(QRect(10,10, 70,100), 100*16, 160*16); // draws a "(" arc

    startAngle, int spanAngle)

    \overload

    Draws a chord that fits inside the rectangle (\a{x}, \a{y}, \a{w},
    \a{h}) with the given \a startAngle and \a spanAngle.
*/


/*!
    \fn void Q3Painter::drawChord(const QRect &r, int a int alen)

    Draws a chord defined by the rectangle \a r, the start angle \a a
    and the arc length \a alen.

    The chord is filled with the current brush().

    The angles \a a and \a alen are 1/16th of a degree, i.e. a full
