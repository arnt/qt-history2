    \class QAbstractItemDelegate qabstractitemdelegate.h

    \brief The QAbstractItemDelegate class is used to display and edit
    data items from a model.

    \ingroup model-view

    A QAbstractItemDelegate provides the interface and common functionality
    for delegates in the model/view architecture. Delegates display
    individual items in views, and handle the editing of model data.

    To render an item in a custom way, you must implement paint() and
    sizeHint(). The QItemDelegate class provides default implementations for
    these functions; if you do not need custom rendering, subclass that
    class instead.

    To provide custom editing, there are two approaches that can be
    used. The first approach is to create an editor widget and display
    it directly on top of the item. To do this you must reimplement
    editor() and editorType() to provide an editor widget,
    setEditorData() to populate the editor with the data from the model,
    setModelData() so that the delegate can update the model with data
    from the editor, and releaseEditor() to destroy your editor when
    it is no longer needed. The second approach is to handle user
    events directly. To do this you could reimplement event().

/*!
    \enum QAbstractItemDelegate::EditorType

    This enum describes what must be done to create an editor for an
    item.

    \value Widget The editor() is a widget.
    \value PersistentWidget The editor() is a widget whose ownership
    is not passed to the QAbstractItemDelegate and which must be
    deleted manually when no longer required.
    \value Events There is no editor() widget; used if event() is
    reimplemented.
*/

/*!
    \enum QAbstractItemDelegate::BeginEditAction

    This enum describes how an editor was invoked to edit an item.

    \value NeverEdit The item cannot be edited.
    \value CurrentChanged The focus was moved to the item.
    \value DoubleClicked The item was double-clicked.
    \value SelectedClicked The item was select-clicked (e.g.
    Shift+Click, or Ctrl+Click).
    \value EditKeyPressed An edit key was pressed (often F2).
    \value AnyKeyPressed A key was pressed when the item had the
    focus.
    \value AlwaysEdit The editor is always present.
*/

/*!
    \enum QAbstractItemDelegate::EndEditAction

    \value Accepted The user accepted their edit. (Usually signified
    by pressing Enter.)
    \value Cancelled The user rejected their edit. (Usually signified
    by pressing Esc.)

    The arguments are the \a editor that was used and an \a action
    which indicates how the editing came to end, i.e., whether the
    user \c Accepted or \c Cancelled their edit.
