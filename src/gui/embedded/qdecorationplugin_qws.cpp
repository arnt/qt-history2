    \brief The QDecorationPlugin class is an abstract base class for
    window decoration plugins in Qtopia Core.

    Note that this class is only available in \l {Qtopia Core}.

    \l {Qtopia Core} provides three ready-made decoration styles: \c
    Default, \c Styled and \c Windows. Custom decorations can be
    implemented by subclassing the QDecoration class and creating a
    decoration plugin.

    A decoration plugin can be created by subclassing
    QDecorationPlugin and implementing the pure virtual keys() and
    create() functions. By exporting the derived class using the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro, \l {Qtopia Core}'s implementation of the
    QDecorationFactory class will automatically detect the plugin and
    load the driver into the application at runtime. See \l{How to
    Create Qt Plugins} for details.

    To actually apply a decoration, use the
    QApplication::qwsSetDecoration() function.

    \sa QDecoration, QDecorationFactory

/*!
    \fn QStringList QDecorationPlugin::keys() const

    Returns the list of valid keys, i.e., the decorations supported by
    this plugin.

    Creates a decoration matching the given \a key. Note that keys are
    case-insensitive.
