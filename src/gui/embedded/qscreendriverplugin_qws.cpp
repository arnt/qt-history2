    \brief The QScreenDriverPlugin class is an abstract base class for
    graphics driver plugins.

    Note that this class is only available in \l {Qtopia Core}.

    QScreenDriverPlugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it easy
    to create custom graphics drivers that can be loaded dynamically into
    applications using the QScreenDriverFactory class.

    Writing a custom graphics driver plugin is achieved by subclassing
    QScreenDriverPlugin, reimplementing the pure virtual keys() and
    create() functions, and exporting the class using the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro. See \l{How to Create Qt Plugins} for
    details.

/*!
    \fn QStringList QScreenDriverPlugin::keys() const

    Returns the list of valid keys, i.e. the screen drivers supported
    by this plugin.

    \l {Qtopia Core} currently supports the following drivers by
    default: \c QVfb (\l {Qtopia Core}'s virtual framebuffer), \c
    LinuxFb (The Linux framebuffer), \c Transformed (for rotated
    displays) and \c VNC (a \l {The VNC Protocol}{VNC} server).

    Constructs a graphics driver plugin with the given \a parent.

    Note that this constructor is invoked automatically by the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro, so there is no need for calling it
    explicitly.

    \fn QScreen* QScreenDriverPlugin::create(const QString &key, int displayId)

    Creates a plugin matching the driver specified by the given \a key,
