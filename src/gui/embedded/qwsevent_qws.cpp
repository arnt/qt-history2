    \class QWSEvent
    \ingroup qws

    \brief The QWSEvent class encapsulates an event in Qtopia Core.

    When running a \l {Qtopia Core} application, it either runs as a server
    or connects to an existing server. In the client/server protocol,
    each event is sent as a QWSEvent object to the server.

    QWSEvent provides the Type enum specifying the origin of
    the event. Internally, each type is represented by a QWSEvent
    subclass, e.g. QWSKeyEvent.

    Note that the QApplication class provides the virtual \l
    {QApplication::qwsEventFilter()}{qwsEventFilter()} function which
    can be reimplemented to get direct access to all QWS (Q Window
    System) events that are received from the QWS master process.

/*!
    \enum QWSEvent::Type

    This enum specifies the event's type.

    \value NoEvent No event has occurred.
    \value Connected An application has connected to the server.
    \value Mouse A mouse button is pressed or released, or the mouse cursor is moved.
             See also \l {Qtopia Core Pointer Handling}.
    \value Focus A window has lost or received focus.
    \value Key A key is pressed or released. See also \l {Qtopia Core Character Input}.
    \value Region A region has changed.
    \value Creation The server has created an ID, typically for a window.
    \value PropertyNotify A property has changed.
    \value PropertyReply The server is responding to a request for a property's value.
    \value SelectionClear A selection is deleted.
    \value SelectionRequest The server has queried for a selection.
    \value SelectionNotify A new selection has been created.
    \value MaxWindowRect The server has changed the maximum window for an application.
    \value QCopMessage A new Qt Cop message has appeared.
    \value WindowOperation A window operation, e.g. resizing, has occurred.
    \value IMEvent An input method has been used  to enter text for languages with
              non-Latin alphabets. See also QWSInputMethod.
    \value IMQuery An input method query for a specified property has occurred.
             See also QWSInputMethod.
    \value NEvent The number of events has changed.
    \value Embed An event used internally to implement
           \l {QWSEmbedWidget}{embedded windows}.
