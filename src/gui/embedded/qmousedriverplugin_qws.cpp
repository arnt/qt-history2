    \brief The QMouseDriverPlugin class provides an abstract base for
    Qtopia Core mouse driver plugins.

    The mouse driver plugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it
    easy to create custom mouse drivers.

    Writing a mouse driver plugin is achieved by subclassing this
    base class, reimplementing the pure virtual functions keys() and
    create(), and exporting the class with the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2()
    macro. See \l{How to Create Qt Plugins} for details.

    This class is only available in Qtopia Core.
