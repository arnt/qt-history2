    \brief The QMouseDriverPlugin class is an abstract base class for
    mouse driver plugins.

    Note that this class is only available in \l {Qtopia Core}.

    QMouseDriverPlugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it easy
    to create custom mouse drivers that can be loaded dynamically
    into applications using the QMouseDriverFactory class.

    Writing a custom mouse driver plugin is achieved by subclassing
    QMouseDriverPlugin, reimplementing the pure virtual keys() and
    create() functions, and exporting the class with the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro. See \l{How to Create Qt Plugins} for
    details.

/*!
    \fn QStringList QMouseDriverPlugin::keys() const

    Returns the list of valid keys, i.e. mouse drivers supported by this plugin.

    \l {Qtopia Core} currently supports the following drivers by
    default: \c MouseMan, \c IntelliMouse, \c Microsoft, \c VR41xx, \c
    LinuxTP, \c Yopy and \c Tslib.

    Constructs a mouse driver plugin with the given \a parent.

    Note that this constructor is invoked automatically by the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro, so there is no need for calling it
    explicitly.

    Destroys the mouse driver plugin.

    Note that Qt destroys a plugin automatically when it is no longer
    used, so there is no need for calling the destructor explicitly.

    \fn QScreen* QMouseDriverPlugin::create(const QString &key, const QString& device)

    Creates a driver matching the type specified by the given \a key
