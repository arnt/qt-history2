    \class QInputContext qinputcontext.h
    \brief The QInputContext class abstracts the input method dependent data and composing state.

    \ingroup i18n

    An input method is responsible to input complex text that cannot
    be inputted via simple keymap. It converts a sequence of input
    events (typically key events) into a text string through the input
    method specific converting process. The class of the processes are
    widely ranging from simple finite state machine to complex text
    translator that pools a whole paragraph of a text with text
    editing capability to perform grammar and semantic analysis.

    To abstract such different input method specific intermediate
    information, Qt offers the QInputContext as base class. The
    concept is well known as 'input context' in the input method
    domain. an input context is created for a text widget in response
    to a demand. It is ensured that an input context is prepared for
    an input method before input to a text widget.

    Multiple input contexts that is belonging to a single input method
    may concurrently coexist. Suppose multi-window text editor. Each
    text widget of window A and B holds different QInputContext
    instance which contains different state information such as
    partially composed text.

    \section1 Sharing input context between text widgets

    Any input context can be shared between several text widgets to
    reduce resource consumption. In ideal case, each text widgets
    should be allocated dedicated input context. But some complex
    input contexts require slightly heavy resource such as 100
    kilobytes of memory. It prevents quite many text widgets from
    being used concurrently.

    To resolve such problem, we can share an input context. There is
    one 'input context holder widget' per text widgets that shares
    identical input context. In this model, the holder widget owns the
    shared input context. Other text widgets access the input context
    via QApplication::locateICHolderWidget(). But the access
    convention is transparently hidden into QWidget, so developers are
    not required to aware of it.

    What developer should know is only the mapping function
    QApplication::locateICHolderWidget(). It accepts a widget as
    argument and returns its holder widget. Default implementation
    returns the top-level widget of the widget as reasonable
    assumption.  But some applications should reimplement the function
    to fit application specific usability. See
    QApplication::locateICHolderWidget() for further information.


    \section1 Preedit preservation

    As described above, input contexts have wide variety of amount of
    the state information in accordance with belonging input
    method. It is ranging from 2-3 keystrokes of sequence in
    deterministic input methods to hundreds of keystrokes with
    semantic text refinement in complex input methods such as ordinary
    Japanese input method. The difference requires the different reset
    policies in losing input focus.

    The former simple input method case, users will prefer resetting
    the context to back to the neutral state when something
    happened. Suppose a web browsing. The user scroll the page by
    scrollbar after he or she has typed a half of the valid key
    sequence into a text widget. In the case, the input context should
    be reset in losing focus when he or she has dragged the
    scrollbar. He or she will be confused if the input context is
    still preserved until focused back to the text widget because he
    or she will restart typing with first key of the sequence as a
    habitual operation.

    On the other hand, we should choose completely different policy
    for the latter complex input method case. Suppose same situation
    as above but he or she is using a complex input method. In the
    case, he or she will be angry if the input context has been lost
    when he or she has dragged the scrollbar because the input context
    contained a valuably composed text made up by considerable input
    cost. So we should not reset the input context in the case. And
    the input context should be preserved until focused back to the
    text widget. This behavior is named as 'preedit preservation'.

    The two policies can be switched by calling or not calling reset()
    in unsetFocus(). Default implementation of unsetFocus() calls
    reset() to fit the simple input methods. The implementation is
    expressed as 'preedit preservation is disabled'.


    \section1 Preedit relocation

    Although the most case of the preedit preservation problem for
    complex input methods is resolved as described above, there is a
    special case. Suppose the case that matches all of the following
    conditions.

    \list

    \i a input focus has been moved from a text widget to another text
    widget directly

    \i the input context is shared between the two text widgets

    \i preedit preservation is enabled for the input context

    \endlist

    In the case, there are the following two requirements that
    contradicts each other. The input context sharing causes it.

    \list

    \i the input context has to be reset to prepare to input to the
    newly focused text widget

    \i the input context has to be preserved until focused back to the
    previous text widget

    \endlist

    A intrinsic feature named 'preedit relocation' is available to
    compromise the requirements. If the feature is enabled for the
    input context, it is simply moved to the new text widget with the
    preedit string. The user continues the input on the new text
    widget, or relocate it to another text widget. The preedit of
    previous text widget is automatically cleared to back to the
    neutral state of the widget.

    This strange behavior is just a compromise. As described in
    previous section, complex input method user should not be exposed
    to the risk losing the input context because it contains valuable
    long text made up with considerable input cost. The user will
    immediately focus back to the previous text widget to continue the
    input in the correct text widget if the preedit relocation
    occurred. The feature is mainly existing as safety.

    The feature properly works even if the focus is moved as
    following. Input method developers are not required to be aware of
    the relocation protocol since QInputContext transparently handles
    it.

    a text widget -> a non-text widget -> another text widget

    To enable the preedit relocation feature, the input context class
    have to reimplement isPreeditRelocationEnabled() as returns true.
    The implementation requires that the preedit preservation is also
    enabled since preedit relocation is a special case of the preedit
    preservation. If the preedit relocation is disabled, the input
    context is simply reset in the relocation case.
