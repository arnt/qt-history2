    \class QMouseEvent qevent.h
    \ingroup events

    \brief The QMouseEvent class contains parameters that describe a mouse event.

    Mouse events occur when a mouse button is pressed or released
    inside a widget, or when the mouse cursor is moved.

    Mouse move events will occur only when a mouse button is pressed
    down, unless mouse tracking has been enabled with
    QWidget::setMouseTracking().

    Qt automatically grabs the mouse when a mouse button is pressed
    inside a widget; the widget will continue to receive mouse events
    until the last mouse button is released.

    A mouse event contains a special accept flag that indicates
    whether the receiver wants the event. You should call ignore() if
    the mouse event is not handled by your widget. A mouse event is
    propagated up the parent widget chain until a widget accepts it
    with accept(), or an event filter consumes it.

    The functions pos(), x(), and y() give the cursor position
    relative to the widget that receives the mouse event. If you
    move the widget as a result of the mouse event, use the global
    position returned by globalPos() to avoid a shaking motion.

    The QWidget::setEnabled() function can be used to enable or
    disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    The event handlers QWidget::mousePressEvent(),
    QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent(), QWidget::mouseDoubleClickEvent(),
    and QWidget::mouseMoveEvent() receive mouse events.

    The \a type parameter must be one of \c QEvent::MouseButtonPress,

    The \a position is the mouse cursor's position relative to the
    receiving widget.
    The \a button that caused the event is given as a value from
    the \l Qt::ButtonState enum. If the event \a type is
    \c MouseMove, the appropriate button for this event is
    \c Qt::NoButton (0).
    The \a state is the \link Qt::ButtonState Qt::ButtonState \endlink

    \class QCloseEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QCloseEvent class contains parameters that describe a close event.

    \ingroup events

    Close events are sent to widgets that the user wants to close,
    usually by choosing "Close" from the window menu, or by clicking
    the `X' title bar button. They are also sent when you call
    QWidget::close() to close a widget programmatically.

    Close events contain a flag that indicates whether the receiver
    wants the widget to be closed or not. When a widget accepts the
    close event, it is hidden (and destroyed if it was created with
    the \c Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose flag). If it refuses to accept the close
    event nothing happens. (Under X11 it is possible that the window
    manager will forcibly close the window; but at the time of writing
    we are not aware of any window manager that does this.)

    The application's main widget -- QApplication::mainWidget() --
    is a special case. When it accepts the close event, Qt leaves the
    main event loop and the application is immediately terminated
    (i.e. it returns from the call to QApplication::exec() in the
    main() function).

    The event handler QWidget::closeEvent() receives close events. The
    default implementation of this event handler accepts the close
    event. If you do not want your widget to be hidden, or want some
    special handing, you should reimplement the event handler and
    ignore() the event.

    The \link simple-application.html#closeEvent closeEvent() in the
    Application Walkthrough\endlink shows a close event handler that
    asks whether to save a document before closing.

    If you want the widget to be deleted when it is closed, create it
    with the \c Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose flag. This is very useful for
    independent top-level windows in a multi-window application.

    \l{QObject}s emits the \link QObject::destroyed()
    destroyed()\endlink signal when they are deleted.

    If the last top-level window is closed, the
    QApplication::lastWindowClosed() signal is emitted.

    The isAccepted() function returns true if the event's receiver has
    agreed to close the widget; call accept() to agree to close the
    widget and call ignore() if the receiver of this event does not
    want the widget to be closed.

    Context menu events are sent to widgets when a user performs

    The actions required to open context menus vary between platforms;
    for example, on Windows, pressing the menu button or clicking the
    right mouse button will cause this event to be sent.

    When this event occurs it is customary to show a QMenu with a
    context menu, if this is relevant to the context.

    Context menu events contain a special accept flag that indicates
    whether the receiver accepted the event. If the event handler does
    not accept the event then, if possible, whatever triggered the event will be
    handled as a regular input event.

    \class QInputMethodEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QInputMethodEvent class provides parameters for input method events.

    \ingroup events

    Input method events are sent to widgets when an input method is
    used to enter text into a widget. Input methods are widely used
    to enter text for languages with non-Latin alphabets.

    The events are of interest to authors of keyboard entry widgets
    who want to be able to correctly handle languages with complex
    character input. Text input in such languages is usually a three
    step process.

    \list 1
    \i <b>Starting to Compose</b><br>
    When the user presses the first key on a keyboard, an input
    context is created. This input context will contain a string
    of the typed characters.

    \i <b>Composing</b><br>
    With every new key pressed, the input method will try to create a
    matching string for the text typed so far. While the input context
    is active, the user can only move the cursor inside the string
    belonging to this input context.

    \i <b>Completing</b><br>
    At some point, the user will activate a user interface component
    (perhaps using a particular key) where they can choose from a
    number of strings matching the text they have typed so far. The
    user can either confirm their choice cancel the input; in either
    case the input context will be closed.
    \endlist

    These three stages are represented by three different types of
    events: InputMethodStart, InputMethodCompose, and InputMethodEnd. All of these events are
    delivered to the imEvent() method. When a new input context is
    created, an InputMethodStart event will be sent to the widget.  The widget
    can then update internal data structures to reflect this.

    After this, an InputMethodCompose event will be sent to the widget for
    every key the user presses. It will contain the current
    composition string the widget has to show and the current cursor
    position within the composition string. This string is temporary
    and can change with every key the user types, so the widget will
    need to store the state before the composition started (the state
    it had when it received the InputMethodStart event).

    Usually, widgets try to mark the part of the text that is part of
    the current composition in a way that is visible to the user. A
    commonly used visual cue is to use a dotted underline.

    After the user has selected the final string, an InputMethodEnd event will
    be sent to the widget. The event contains the final string the
    user selected, and could be empty if they canceled the
    composition. This string should be accepted as the final text the
    user entered, and the intermediate composition string should be
    cleared.

    If the user clicks another widget, taking the focus out of the
    widget where the composition is taking place, the InputMethodEnd event will
    be sent and the string it holds will be the result of the
    composition up to that point (which may be an empty string).

*/

/*!
    \class QTabletEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QTabletEvent class contains parameters that describe a Tablet event.

    \ingroup events

    Tablet Events are generated from a Wacom tablet. Most of
    the time you will want to deal with events from the tablet as if
    they were events from a mouse; for example, you would retrieve the
    cursor position with x(), y(), pos(), globalX(), globalY(), and
    globalPos(). In some situations you may wish to retrieve the extra
    information provided by the tablet device driver; for example, you
    might want to adjust color brightness based on pressure.
    QTabletEvent allows you to read the pressure(), the xTilt(), and
    yTilt(), as well as the type of device being used with device()
    (see \l{TabletDevice}).

    A tablet event contains a special accept flag that indicates
    whether the receiver wants the event. You should call
    QTabletEvent::accept() if you handle the tablet event; otherwise
    it will be sent to the parent widget.

    The QWidget::setEnabled() function can be used to enable or
    disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    The event handler QWidget::tabletEvent() receives all three types of
    tablet events. Qt will first send a tabletEvent then, if it is not
    accepted, it will send a mouse event.  This allows applications that
    don't utilize tablets to use a tablet like a mouse, while also
    enabling those who want to use both tablets and mouses differently.

    When a drag and drop action is completed, the target is expected
    to perform an Action on the data provided by the source. This
    will be one of the following:

    \value Copy The default action. The source simply uses the data
                provided in the operation.
    \value Link The source should somehow create a link to the
                location specified by the data.
    \value Move The source should somehow move the object from the
                location specified by the data to a new location.
    \value Private  The target has special knowledge of the MIME type,
                which the source should respond to in a similar way to
                a Copy.
    \value UserAction  The source and target can co-operate using
                special actions. This feature is not currently
                supported.

    The Link and Move actions only makes sense if the data is a
    reference, for example, text/uri-list file lists (see QUriDrag).
