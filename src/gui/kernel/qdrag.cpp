    \class QDrag
    \brief The QDrag class provides support for MIME-based drag and drop data
    transfer.

    Drag and drop is an intuitive way for users to copy or move data around in an
    application, and is used in many desktop environments as a mechanism for copying
    data between applications. Drag and drop support in Qt is centered around the
    QDrag class that handles most of the details of a drag and drop operation.

    The data to be transferred by the drag and drop operation is contained in a
    QMimeData object. This is specified with the setMimeData() function in the
    following way:

    \quotefromfile snippets/dragging/mainwindow.cpp
    \skipto mousePressEvent
    \skipto QDrag
    \printuntil setMimeData

    Note that setMimeData() assigns ownership of the QMimeData object to the
    QDrag object. The QDrag must be constructed on the heap with a parent QObject
    to ensure that Qt can clean up after the drag and drop operation has been
    completed.

    A pixmap can be used to represent the data while the drag is in progress, and
    will move with the cursor to the drop target. This pixmap typically shows an
    icon that represents the MIME type of the data being transferred, but any
    pixmap can be set with setPixmap(). Care must be taken to ensure that the
    pixmap is not too large. The cursor's hot spot can be given a position relative
    to the top-left corner of the pixmap with the setHotSpot() function. The
    following code positions the pixmap so that the cursor's hot spot points to
    the center of its bottom edge:

    \quotefromfile snippets/separations/finalwidget.cpp
    \skipto setHotSpot
    \printuntil ;

    The source and target widgets can be found with source() and target().
    These functions are often used to determine whether drag and drop operations
    started and finished at the same widget, so that special behavior can be
    implemented.

    QDrag only deals with the drag and drop operation itself. It is up to the
    developer to decide when a drag operation begins, and how a QDrag object should
    be constructed and used. For a given widget, it is often necessary to
    reimplement \l{QWidget::mousePressEvent()}{mousePressEvent()} to determine
    whether the user has pressed a mouse button, and reimplement
    \l{QWidget::mouseMoveEvent()}{mouseMoveEvent()} to check whether a QDrag is
    required.
