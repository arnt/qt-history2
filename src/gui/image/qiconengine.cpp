  \bold {Use QIconEngineV2 instead.}

  An icon engine provides the rendering functions for a QIcon. Each icon has a
  corresponding icon engine that is responsible for drawing the icon with a
  requested size, mode and state.

  The icon is rendered by the paint() function, and the icon can additionally be
  obtained as a pixmap with the pixmap() function (the default implementation
  simply uses paint() to achieve this). The addPixmap() function can be used to
  add new pixmaps to the icon engine, and is used by QIcon to add specialized
  custom pixmaps.

  The paint(), pixmap(), and addPixmap() functions are all virtual, and can
  therefore be reimplemented in subclasses of QIconEngine.

    \brief The QIconEngineV2 class provides an abstract base class for QIcon renderers.

    \ingroup multimedia
    \since 4.3

    An icon engine renders \l{QIcon}s. With icon engines, you can
    customize icons. Qt provides a default engine that makes icons
    adhere to the current style by scaling the icons and providing a
    disabled appearance.

    An engine is installed on an icon either through a QIcon
    constructor or through a QIconEnginePluginV2. The plugins are used
    by Qt if a specific engine is not given when the icon is created.
    See the QIconEngineV2 class description to learn how to create
    icon engine plugins.

    An icon engine provides the rendering functions for a QIcon. Each
    icon has a corresponding icon engine that is responsible for drawing
    the icon with a requested size, mode and state.

    QIconEngineV2 extends the API of QIconEngine to allow streaming of
    the icon engine contents, and should be used instead of QIconEngine
    for implementing new icon engines.
