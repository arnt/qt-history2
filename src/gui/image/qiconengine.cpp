  \class QIconEngine

  \brief The QIconEngine class provides an abstract base class for QIcon renderers.

  \ingroup multimedia

  An icon engine provides the rendering functions for a QIcon. Each icon has a
  corresponding icon engine that is responsible for drawing the icon with a
  requested size, mode and state.

  The icon is rendered by the paint() function, and the icon can additionally be
  obtained as a pixmap with the pixmap() function (the default implementation
  simply uses paint() to achieve this). The addPixmap() function can be used to
  add new pixmaps to the icon engine, and is used by QIcon to add specialized
  custom pixmaps.

  The paint(), pixmap(), and addPixmap() functions are all virtual, and can
  therefore be reimplemented in subclasses of QIconEngine.
