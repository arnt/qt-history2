This is here so I can test making p4i smart about which branch it should be
integrating to. Currently:

3.0 -> 3.1
3.1 -> main

Currently I'll just do it with a map like this, I think:

$targetBranch{"3.0"}="3.1";
$targetBranch{"3.1"}="main";

Makes it nice and simple to add new ones in the future...
