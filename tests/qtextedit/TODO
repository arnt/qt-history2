high priority:
-----------------
- Implement selection in nested custom items (tables)
- Cleanup formatcollection to make the memory handling of the formats (ownership, etc.) cleaner and fix mem leaks
- Links in floating tables/items
- Minimumwidth in BreakWords has to be one word, not one letter

Low priority:
----------------
- Undo/Redo has to support formats (does only plain text at the moment)
- Copy/Paste/DnD in richtext (HTML subset? - what does mozilla?) too
- Editing in tables must not change the width of a cell
