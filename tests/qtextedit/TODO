High priority:
-------------
- Implement proper minimumWidth of documents
- Implement selection with nested custom items
- Cleanup formatcollection to make the memory handling of the formats (ownership, etc.) cleaner
- Fix textflow/dpi stuff for printing (esp. on windows)
- popup detail stuff in QTextBrowser/html parser
- fix the problem with #ababab links (somehow the anchors get lost between parsing and 
  building the internal data structure)

Not so high:
---------
- Draw Big custom widgets without double buffering
  (current implementation only caches double buffer pixmaps which are small,
   and allocates for one drawing maxim. an image of the size of the window,
   so it is not too bad)
- Implement HTML export
- Undo/Redo has to support formats (does only plain text at the moment)
- Copy/Paste/DnD in richtext (HTML subset? - what does mozilla?) too
