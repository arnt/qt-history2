cp /cdrom/Embedded/qt-embedded-commercial-3.3.2.tar.gz .
gunzip qt-embedded-commercial-3.3.2.tar.gz
tar xf qt-embedded-commercial-3.3.2.tar

This will create the directory @F "/usr/local/qt-embedded-commercial-3.3.2" which
will contain the files from the archive, and where @F "/usr/local" is
an example of where you wish to install Qt and @F "/cdrom/Embedded" is
an example of where the Qt"/"Embedded directory would be depending on
how your CD-ROM is mounted.
}

    @AlphaList
    @LI { Set @F QTDIR to the directory where the Qt"/"Embedded files have been
    installed.  All other paths needed by the build system or by the
    Qt"/"Embedded development tools will be derived from this

    @EndList
Depending on which shell you use, add the relevant lines to your profile file
or login file (for example, @F{.bash_profile}  or @F{.login}).
@PP
After you have done this, you must either login again, or re-source the file
you've just edited before continuing, so that @F{$QTDIR} is set.
}
@LI { Execute the configure tool at the command prompt with your preferred
options. 
@PP
For example, use @F "./configure -release -shared" to build Qt"/"Embedded
as a shared library, without debug information.  Type @F "./configure -help"
to get a list of all available options.  
}
@LI { When prompted, enter in your license key as it appears on the CD cover.

Run the @F{qt-win-commercial-3.3.2.exe} program and go through all the
steps of the installation wizard:
@NumberedList
@LI { Enter in your license key as it appears on the CD cover. }
@LI { Read the license.  You are only able to continue the installation
if you accept the license. }
@LI { Select where you want to install Qt and which parts of Qt you want
to install. 
@PP
You must also choose which development tool you want to
use with Qt. The wizard will only allow you to choose one, but you
can set the system up to use any other development tools later. }
@LI { Choose which program menu folder Qt should install its icons into.
@PP
The checkbox for setting @F QTDIR is to choose whether or not the
environment variable @F QTDIR should be set or modified.  If checked,
@F QTDIR will be set to point to the directory where you installed Qt.
If @F QTDIR is already set, (if Qt is already installed, which may be
another version) this checkbox will be cleared by default, to avoid
accidental modifications to your setup.  If you have chosen to use
Microsoft Visual Studio{@Sup @Register} then you must also specify the
path to the installation of Microsoft Visual Studio. This allows Qt to
integrate itself into the development environment. }
@LI { Configure the library. 
@PP
You can choose several options and configurations for building the Qt
library. The default options should be sufficient for most cases. The
library can also be reconfigured later with the @F{configure.exe} program.
After this, the wizard unpacks the files into the installation
directory and compiles the toolkit. Logs of both the installation and
building are saved to the installation directory. If you selected
Microsoft Visual Studio as your development environment, the wizard
also integrates the Qt tools into Visual Studio.
}
@EndList
@B Note: When installing the toolkit on a Windows 9x system, the
compilation step is skipped, due to technical limitations in the
operating system. The installation program writes the steps needed to
build the toolkit into a batch file and puts a shortcut to this in the
start menu. To build it, just click on this shortcut.  
@PP
Some Windows versions may require a reboot before all environment
variables are activated.
@PP

problems with installing Qt then refer to the @F INSTALL file in
