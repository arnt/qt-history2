@CD @Heading { Welcome to Qt! }
@PP
Congratulations! If you're new to Qt then you are going to be amazed by how
much easy-to-use power it gives you. And if you're an experienced Qt user,
this version of Qt gives you what you'd expect: more ease-of-use, more power,
more functionality and more programming pleasure than ever before.
@PP 
The Qt Application Development Toolkit is an internationally renowned C++
class library and toolset. Qt helps you design cross-platform graphical user
interfaces quickly and easily. Qt includes @I{Qt Designer}, our visual
design tool that uses layouts to produce beautiful scalable
cross-platform GUIs. Qt comes with tools to help you make your
applications multi-lingual as well as cross-platform, to ensure the
widest possible audience for your applications. At the heart of Qt is
the C++ library itself, which provides consistency, ease-of-use, power
and extensive functionality, to help you build your own world-class
applications. We're so proud of Qt's quality that we include our
source code so that you can see it for yourself.
@DP
We've included a flyer that explains how to install Qt for each version
supplied on the CD. Pick the installation flyer for your operating system and
follow the instructions to get Qt installed on your machine.
@DP
If you're new to Qt we have some suggestions for where to begin, since Qt
introduces some innovations to C++ programming, especially its signals and
slots mechanism, which provides a type-safe alternative to the crude callbacks
used in older toolkits.
@PP
Qt is extensively documented and comes with numerous examples. Run the @I{Qt
Assistant} application to launch Qt's on-line help system. @I{Qt Assistant}
presents the Qt Reference Documentation on start up. 
@PP
The easiest way to get started with Qt programming is to work through the
first two chapters of the @I{Qt Designer} tutorial (included in the
@I{Qt's Graphical Development Tools} book, and also in the on-line help). 
@PP
Once you're familiar with @I{Qt Designer} you might like to try
working through the on-line tutorial (in the Getting Started section)
to get more of a feel for Qt programming in pure C++. We also
recommend that you read the Signals and Slots overview. At this point
you should be able to make productive use of Qt, learning everything
else as you go along. The overviews and some of the modules contain
lots of practical information. Qt also comes with a large collection
of examples in the @F examples folder, which you can use for ideas and
inspiration. Qt has a supportive on-line user community, which uses
the @F{qt-interest} mailing list. And as a registered Qt licensee you can
use Trolltech's professional support service. 
@DP
We hope that you have fun creating great applications with Qt!
