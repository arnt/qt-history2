From Qt 3.1, @QAT offers a powerfull full text search
engine. In order to search for certain words or text, go to the
'Search' tab in the sidebar. Then enter the text you are looking
for and press @Option{Enter} or click @Option{Search}. The search is always
case insensitive, so Deep, dEEp and DEEP are all treated as the
same. The following search patterns can be used:

@VeryWideTaggedList
@TagItem{ @Code{deep} } { lists all the documents that contain the
word 'deep'
}
@TagItem{ @Code{deep*} } { lists all the documents that contain a
word beginning with 'deep'
}
@TagItem{ @Code{deep copy} } { lists all documents that contain both
'deep' @I{and} 'copy'
}
@TagItem{ @Code{"deep copy"} } { list all documents that contain
the phrase 'deep copy'
}
@EndList

The wildcard (*) character cannot be used within quotes.

@PP
The list of documents is ordered according to the number of occurrences
of the search text they contain, with those with the highest
number of occurrences appearing first. Simply click any document
in the list to have it display in the document pane.

@PP
If the documentation is changed, e.g. if new documents are added
or old ones removed, @QAT will reindex. At present
this only works for latin1 encoded documents, i.e. Unicode is
not yet supported.
