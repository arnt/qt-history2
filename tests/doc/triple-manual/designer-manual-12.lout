@I{Qt Designer}'s toolbar buttons provide fast access to common
functionality. Toolbar buttons are grouped in several toolbars.
Toolbars have a handle at the left hand side which can be clicked
to minimize the toolbar. Toolbars that have been minimized have
their handle appear just under the menu bar; click the handle
to restore the toolbar to the last position it occupied. You
can drag a toolbar's handle to move the toolbar to a different
position in the toolbar area. Toolbars can be dragged out of
the toolbar area entirely and made into stand-alone tool dock
windows. To hide a tool dock window click its close button. To
restore a hidden tool dock window, right click the tool area,
then click the name of the tool dock window you wish to restore.

The tools toolbar buttons are available through toolbars (as
they have always been prior to Qt 3.1), and also via the new
Toolbox. From Qt 3.1, the tools toolbars are hidden and the Toolbox
is shown. The Toolbox is divided into groups, with the first
group being "\""Common Widgets"\"" which contains the widgets you're
likely to use most often. If you prefer to use the original toolbar
setup, you can access the toolbars by clicking @B{Windows"|"Toolbars}
and then selecting the toolbars you want to be visible from the
context menu.

@PP
The Toolbox contains categories describing the type of toolbuttons
you can find within each catgory. Click a category name to access
the toolbuttons in that category. To use a widget in a category,
click the widget to activate it. Click the 'x' in the right hand
corner of the Toolbox to close it. To make the Toolbox appear
again, click @B{Window"|"Views"|"Toolbox}.

If you want to add the same kind of widget several times to a
form, for example, several push buttons, @I{double click} the
widget's toolbar button. After this, each time you click the
form a new widget will be added. Click the @B{Pointer} toolbar
button to leave this mode.
