@LP
Under Windows, @QAT is available as a menu option
on the Qt menu. On Unix, run @File{assistant} from an
@File{xterm}.

@PP
When you start up @QAT, you will be presented with
a standard main-window style application, with a menu bar and
toolbar. Below these, on the left hand side is a navigation window
called the @I{Sidebar}, and on the right, taking up most of the
space, is the documentation window. By default, the Qt Reference
Documentation's home page is shown in the documentation window.

@PP
@QAT works in a similar way to a web browser. If
you click underlined text (which signifies a cross-reference),
the documentation window will present the relevant page. You
can bookmark pages of particular interest and you can click the
@Option{Previous} and @Option{Next} toolbar buttons to navigate within
the pages you've visited.

@PP
Although @QAT can be used just like a web browser
to navigate through the Qt documentation set, @QAT
offers a powerful means of navigation that web browsers don't
provide. @QAT uses an intelligent algorithm to index
all the pages in the documentation sets that it presents so that
you can search for particular words and phrases.

@PP
To perform a search, click the @Option{Index} tab on the Sidebar (or
click @Option{Ctrl+I}). In the 'Look For' line edit enter a word,
e.g. 'homedirpath'. As you type, words are found and highlighted
in a list beneath the line edit. If the highlighted text matches
what you're looking for, double click it, (or press @Option{Enter})
and the documentation window will display the relevant page.
You rarely have to type in the whole word before @QAT
finds a match.

@PP
For some words there may be more than one possible page that
is relevant. For example, enter 'setenabled' in the 'Look For'
line edit. As you type, words are found and highlighted in the
list beneath the line edit, as before. Once the highlighted text
matches what you're looking for, double click it, (or press @Option{Enter}).
In the case of setEnabled, it is a function name which occurs
in several classes, so a dialog pops up listing the possible
choices. Click the choice you're interested in (or move to it
using the @Option{Up} and @Option{Down} arrow keys and press @Option{Enter}).
The relevant page will display in the documentation window.
