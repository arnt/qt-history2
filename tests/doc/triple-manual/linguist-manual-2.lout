Two tools are provided for the release manager, @File{lupdate} and
@File{lrelease}. These tools depend on @File{qmake} project files. You
don't have to use @File{qmake}, though.
release.manager @Index{ Release Manager }

@LP
A third tool, @File{qm2ts}, can be used for converting
Qt 2.x message files to @File{.ts} files.

@File{lupdate} and @File{lrelease} depend on
information in the application's @File{.pro} Qt project file.
There must be an entry in the @Code{TRANSLATIONS} section of
the project file for each language that is additional to the native
language. A typical entry looks like this:
pro.files @Index{ .pro Files }
project.files @Index{ Project Files }
qmake @RawIndex{ qmake }
qmake.project.files @SubIndex{ Project Files }
translations @RawIndex{ TRANSLATIONS }
translations.in.project.files @SubIndex{ in Project Files }
@LD @Code @RawVerbatim @Begin
    TRANSLATIONS    = tt2_fr.ts \
                      tt2_nl.ts
@End @RawVerbatim
Using a locale within the translation file name is useful for
determining which language to load at runtime. This is explained
in @NamePageRef{programmers}.

@LP
An example of a complete @File{.pro} file with four translation
source files:
headers @RawIndex{ HEADERS }
headers.in.project.files @SubIndex{ in Project Files }
sources @RawIndex{ SOURCES }
sources.in.project.files @SubIndex{ in Project Files }
forms @RawIndex{ FORMS }
forms.in.project.files @SubIndex{ in Project Files }
translations @RawIndex{ TRANSLATIONS }
translations.in.project.files @SubIndex{ in Project Files }
@LD @Code @RawVerbatim @Begin
    HEADERS         = main-dlg.h \
                      options-dlg.h
    SOURCES         = main-dlg.cpp \
                      options-dlg.cpp \
                      main.cpp 
    FORMS           = search-dlg.ui
    TRANSLATIONS    = superapp_dk.ts \
                      superapp_fi.ts \
                      superapp_no.ts \
                      superapp_se.ts
@End @RawVerbatim
@Func{QApplication::setDefaultCodec()} makes it possible to choose
an 8-bit encoding for literal strings that appear within @Func{tr()}
calls. This is useful for applications whose source language
is, for example, Chinese or Japanese. If no encoding is set,
@Func{tr()} uses Latin-1.
qapplication @RawIndex{ QApplication }
qapplication.defaultcodec @SubIndex{ defaultCodec() }
defaultcodec @RawIndex{ defaultCodec() }
defaultcodec.qapplication @SubIndex{ QApplication }
defaultcodec @RawIndex{ DEFAULTCODEC }
defaultcodec.in.project.files @SubIndex{ in Project Files }
chinese.language @Index{ Chinese Language }
japanese.language @Index{ Japanese Language }

@LP
If you do use the @Func{QApplication::defaultCodec()} mechanism in your
application, @QLT needs you to set the @Code{DEFAULTCODEC}
entry in the @File{.pro} file as well. For example:

@LD @Code @RawVerbatim @Begin
    DEFAULTCODEC    = ISO-8859-5
@End @RawVerbatim
@End @Section
@Section
    @Title { lupdate }
    @Tag { lupdate }
@Begin
@LP
Usage: @Code{lupdate myproject.pro}
lupdate @Index{ lupdate }
@LP
This is a simple command line tool. @File{lupdate} reads a Qt @File{.pro}
project file, finds the translatable strings in the specified
source, header and @QDR interface files, and produces
or updates the @File{.ts} translation files listed in
the project file. The translation files are given to the translator
who uses @QLT to read the files and insert the translations.
qt.designer @Index{ Qt Designer }

@LP
Companies that have their own translators in-house may find it
useful to run @File{lupdate} regularly, perhaps monthly, as the application
develops. This will lead to a fairly low volume of translation
work spread evenly over the life of the project and will allow
the translators to support a number of projects simultaneously.

@LP
Companies that hire in translators as required may prefer to
run @File{lupdate} only a few times in the application's life cycle,
the first time might be just before the first test phase. This
will provide the translator with a substantial single block of
work and any bugs that the translator detects may easily be included
with those found during the initial test phase. The second and
any subsequent @File{lupdate} runs would probably take place during
the final beta phase.

@LP
The @File{.ts} file format is a simple human-readable
XML format that can be used with version control systems if required.
ts.files @Index{ .ts Files }
translation.source.files @Index{ Translation Source Files }
xml @Index{ XML }

@End @Section
@Section
    @Title { lrelease }
    @Tag { lrelease }
@Begin
@LP
Usage: @Code{lrelease myproject.pro}
lrelease @Index{ lrelease }

@LP
This is another simple command line tool. It reads a Qt @File{.pro}
project file and produces the @File{.qm} files used by
the application, one for each @File{.ts} translation source
file listed in the project file. The @File{.qm} file format
is a compact binary format that provides extremely fast lookups
for translations.
qm.files @Index{ .qm Files }
qt.message.files @Index{ Qt Message Files }

@LP
This tool is run whenever a release of the application is to
be made, from initial test version through to final release version.
If the @File{.qm} files are not created, e.g. because
an alpha release is required before any translation has been
undertaken, the application will run perfectly well using the
text the programmers placed in the source files. Once the 
@File{.qm} files are available the application will detect
them and use them automatically.

@LP
Note that @File{lrelease} will only incorporate translations that are
marked as `done'. If a translation is missing, or has failed
validation, the original text will be used instead.

@LP
Both @File{lupdate} and @File{lrelease} may be used with @File{.ts}
translation source files which are incomplete. Missing translations
will be replaced with the native language phrases at runtime.
