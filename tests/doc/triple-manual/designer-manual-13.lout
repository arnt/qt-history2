Click @Option{File"|"New} (or press @Option{Ctrl+N}) to invoke the
@Win{New
File} dialog. This dialog offers four kinds of files to choose
from: @Cpp Project, Forms, Source files, and Main files.

@LP
The 'Insert Into' drop-down combobox lists the open projects,
defaulting to the current project. New files are added to the
project displayed in this combobox. To add a new file to a different
project, choose the project you want to use in the 'Insert Into'
combobox.

@LP
The 'Dialog' file type is highlighted by default when the @Win{New
File} dialog pops up. Click on the file type you want to use
and click @OK to create it. Click @Cancel to leave the
dialog without creating a new file. Note that if you select @Cpp
Project, the 'Insert Into' combobox will be disabled, since it
is not possible to insert a new @Cpp Project into an existing
project.

Click @Option{@Cpp Project} to start a new project. This option
invokes the
@NamePageRef{project.settings.dialog}. @Cpp projects are saved as
@File{".pro"} files, which include the information @QDR needs to
manage projects. When you add a form to your project in @QDR, it is
automatically added to the FORMS section of the project file. The
@File{".pro"} file contains the list of forms (@File{".ui"} files)
used in the project. @QDR reads and writes @File{".ui"} files, e.g.
form.ui. The uic (user interface compiler) creates both a header file,
e.g. form.h, and an implementation file, e.g. form.cpp, from the
@File{".ui"} file.

Click @Option{Wizard} to create a wizard form. A wizard is a special
type of input dialog that consists of a sequence of dialog pages.
A wizard's purpose is to assist a user by automating a task by
walking the user through the process step by step. Wizards are
useful for complex or infrequently occurring tasks that people
may find difficult to learn or do. Initially the wizard form
consists of a single dialog page. Use the right click context
menu to add additional pages and to change page titles.

Note for database programmers: If you create a @File{"main.cpp"}
file using @QDR, this file will @I{not} include the
@Func{createConnections()} function. We do not include
this function because it needs the username and password for
the database connection, and you may prefer to handle these differently
from our simple example function. As a result, applications that
preview correctly in @QDR will not run unless you
implement your own database connections function.

    @Title {Pixmaps }
    @Tag{pixmaps}
@Begin
@LP
The default (for projects) is 'Project Imagefile'. This is the
recommended option. Images are handled automatically, with @QDR
storing the images in a subdirectory, and @File{"uic"} producing code
that contains the images and the necessary supporting code. Each image
is stored just once, no matter how many forms it is used in.

@LP
If you do not want @QDR to handle the images, (or
are not using a project) choose either 'Save Inline' or 'Use
Function'. 'Save Inline' saves the pixmaps in the @File{".ui"}
files. The disadvantage of this approach is that it stores images
in the forms in which they're used, meaning that images cannot
be shared across forms. Click 'Use Function' to use your own
icon-loader function for loading pixmaps. Type the function's
name (with no signature) in the 'Use Function' line edit. This
function will be used in the generated code for loading pixmaps.
Your function will be called with the text you put in the pixmap
property (e.g. the image name) whenever an image is required.

The 'General' tab has sections for Background, Grid, General,

@LP
The Background section defaults to 'Pixmap'. To change the default,
click the @Option{Select a Pixmap} button next to the 'Pixmap' radio
button to invoke the @Win{Choose a Pixmap... Dialog}. Click the
'Color' radio button to change the background to a color instead
of a pixmap. Click the @Option{Choose a Color} button located to the

@LP
The 'General' section of the General tab has three checkboxes that are
checked by default. Click the 'Restore last workspace on startup'
checkbox to save the size and positions of the windows and toolbars of
@QDR. The next time you start up @QDR, the windows and toolbars are
restored to their last positions. Click the 'Show Splash Screen on
startup' checkbox to display the @QDR splash screen when you start up
the application. Click the 'Disable Database Auto-Edit in Preview'
checkbox to disable the ability to update or delete data in the
database to which you are connected when working with database
widgets. To change the path @QDR uses to find it's online
documentation, click the 'Documentation Path' line edit and type a new
path. It would be unlikely to have to change this path. Another way to
change the path is to click the @Option{...} button located to the
right of the line edit. This invokes the @Win{Find Directory Dialog}.

@LP
The 'Grid' section has options for customizing the grid on the
form. The 'Show Grid' checkbox located above the 'Grid' section
is checked by default. Developers using @QDR almost
always use Qt's layouts to design their forms and rarely make
any use of the grid. The grid is provided for the rare occasions
when a form is created using widgets with fixed sizes and positions.
When 'Show Grid' is checked, you can customize the grid's appearance.
When it is unchecked, the 'Grid' section is disabled. The 'Snap
to Grid' checkbox is also checked by default. When it is checked,
widgets are placed on a dot (snap to the grid) using the X"|"Y
resolution. When it is unchecked, the 'Grid-X' and 'Grid-Y' spin
boxes are disabled. Click the 'Grid X' and 'Grid Y' spinboxes
to customize the grid settings for all forms.

The 'Toolbars' section has a 'Show Text Labels' checkbox. Click
the checkbox to display the text labels for each icon shown in

Custom widgets are created in code. They may contain a combination
of existing widgets but with additional functionality, slots
and signals, or they may be written from scratch, or a mixture
of both. A custom widget is often a specialization (subclass)
of another widget or a combination of widgets working together
or a blend of both these approaches. If you simply want a collection
of widgets in a particular configuration it is easiest to create
them, select them as a group, and copy and paste them as required
within @QDR. Custom widgets are generally created
when you need to add new functionality to existing widgets or
groups of widgets. To add create a new widget, click the @B{New
Widget} button. You will find more information about adding new
widgets in the 'Definitions Section'. To load a file which contains
