Start up @I{Qt Designer} to invoke the @I{Qt Designer New"/"Open}
dialog. This dialog contains three tabs to use depending on what
you want to do once you start up @I{Qt Designer}.

@LD @I { The New File"/"Project Tab{@PageMark{the.new.file.project.tab}} }
@PP
This tab is the default when you start up @I{Qt Designer}. Choose
to start a new project or to create a file by selecting the appropriate
icon from the window. For more information about the different
file types available, see the The File Dialogs [p.~@PageOf{the.file.dialogs}] section.

@PP
Click the "\""Don't show this dialog in the future"\"" checkbox to
hide the dialog the next time you start up @I{Qt Designer}.

@PP
Click this tab to open an already existing file or project. The
tab shows the current directory and default file type. To choose
a different directory, click the 'Look In' combobox. Choose a
file and the name will appear in the 'File Name' combobox. To
choose a different file type, click the 'File Type' combobox.
Click the 'Create New Folder' toolbar button to create a new
directory. Click the 'List View' toolbar button to view folders
and files in a list with only the names showing. Click the 'Details'
toolbar button to view the folders and file names along with
their size, type, date, and attributes. Click the Size, Type,
Date, or Attributes column headers to sort the folders or files.

@PP

@LD @Heading { New File Dialog{@PageMark{new.file.dialog}} }
@PP
Click @B{File"|"New} (or press @B{Ctrl+N}) to invoke the @I{New
File} dialog. This dialog offers four kinds of files to choose
from: C++ Project, Forms, Source files, and Main files.

@PP
The 'Insert Into' drop-down combobox lists the open projects,
defaulting to the current project. New files are added to the
project displayed in this combobox. To add a new file to a different
project, choose the project you want to use in the 'Insert Into'
combobox.

@PP
The 'Dialog' file type is highlighted by default when the @I{New
File} dialog pops up. Click on the file type you want to use
and click @B{OK} to create it. Click @B{Cancel} to leave the
dialog without creating a new file. Note that if you select C++
Project, the 'Insert Into' combobox will be disabled, since it
is not possible to insert a new C++ Project into an existing
project.

@LD @I { C++ Project Files{@PageMark{c.project.files}} }
@PP
Click @B{C++ Project} to start a new project. This option invokes
the Project Settings Dialog [p.~@PageOf{project.settings.dialog}]. C++ projects are saved as @F @Verbatim{.pro}
files, which include the information @I{Qt Designer} needs to
manage projects. When you add a form to your project in @I{Qt
Designer}, it is automatically added to the FORMS section of
the project file. The @F @Verbatim{.pro} file contains the list
of forms (@F @Verbatim{.ui} files) used in the project. @I{Qt
Designer} reads and writes @F @Verbatim{.ui} files, e.g. form.ui.
The uic (user interface compiler) creates both a header file,
e.g. form.h, and an implementation file, e.g. form.cpp, from
the @F @Verbatim{.ui} file.

@LD @I { Dialog Forms{@PageMark{dialog.forms}} }
@PP
Click @B{Dialog} to create a plain dialog form. Typically, this
type of form is used to present the user with configuration options,
or to present related sets of choices, for example, printer setting
dialogs and find and replace dialogs.

@LD @I { Wizard Forms{@PageMark{wizard.forms}} }
@PP
Click @B{Wizard} to create a wizard form. A wizard is a special
type of input dialog that consists of a sequence of dialog pages.
A wizard's purpose is to assist a user by automating a task by
walking the user through the process step by step. Wizards are
useful for complex or infrequently occurring tasks that people
may find difficult to learn or do. Initially the wizard form
consists of a single dialog page. Use the right click context
menu to add additional pages and to change page titles.

@LD @I { Widget Forms{@PageMark{widget.forms}} }
@PP
Click @B{Widget} to create a form whose superclass is QWidget
rather than QDialog.

@LD @I { Main Window Form{@PageMark{main.window.form}} }
@PP
Click @B{Main Window} to invoke the Main Window Wizard. This
wizard is used to create actions, menu options and toolbars through
which the user can invoke actions. This form is used to create
typical main-window style applications.

@LD @I { Configuration Dialog Form{@PageMark{configuration.dialog.form}} }
@PP
Click @B{Configuration Dialog} creates a form with a listbox
on the left, and a tabwidget filling the body of the form, along
with Help, OK and Cancel buttons.

@LD @I { Dialog with Buttons (Bottom) Form{@PageMark{dialog.with.buttons.bottom.form}} }
@PP
The @B{Dialog with Buttons (Bottom)} form is a template with
default buttons at the bottom of the form.

@LD @I { Dialog with Buttons Form (Right){@PageMark{dialog.with.buttons.form.right}} }
@PP
The @B{Dialog with Buttons (Right)} form is a template with default
buttons at the right of the form.

@LD @I { Tab Dialog Form{@PageMark{tab.dialog.form}} }
@PP
The @B{Tab Dialog} form has a tab widget as its central widget,
along with Help, OK and Cancel buttons along the bottom.

@LD @I { C++ Source File{@PageMark{c.source.file}} }
@PP
Click @B{C++ Source File [p.~@PageOf{c.source.file}]} to create a new empty C++ file. The
file will automatically be added to the project when it is saved.

@LD @I { C++ Header File{@PageMark{c.header.file}} }
@PP
Click @B{C++ Header File [p.~@PageOf{c.header.file}]} to create a new empty C++ header file.
The file will automatically be added to the project when it is
saved.

@LD @I { C++ Main File{@PageMark{c.main.file}} }
@PP
Click @B{C++ Main File [p.~@PageOf{c.main.file}]} to invoke the Configure Main-File Dialog [p.~@PageOf{configure.main.file.dialog}]
which will create a basic @F @Verbatim{main.cpp} file automatically.
C++ Main file is not an option if you do not have a project open.
In addition, this file type is not avalable in the @I{Qt Designer
New"/"Open} dialog because you cannot create a main.cpp file
without creating a project.

@LD @I { Configure Main-File Dialog{@PageMark{configure.main.file.dialog}} }
@PP
@Figure

@PP
Click @B{File"|"New"|"C++ Main-File} to invoke the @I{Configure
Main-File} dialog. Use this dialog to configure the main file
and its forms.

@PP
To change the default file name, type it in the 'Filename' line
edit. Choose the form to use as the application's main form from
the line edit by clicking it.

@PP
Click @B{OK} to accept the configurations and @I{Qt Designer}
will create a default @F @Verbatim{main.cpp} file. Click @B{Cancel}
to leave the dialog.

@PP
Note for database programmers: If you create a @F @Verbatim{main.cpp}
file using @I{Qt Designer}, this file will @I{not} include the
@F @Verbatim{createConnections()} function. We do not include
this function because it needs the username and password for
the database connection, and you may prefer to handle these differently
from our simple example function. As a result, applications that
preview correctly in @I{Qt Designer} will not run unless you
implement your own database connections function.

dialog. Use this dialog to save the form's settings, pixmap,
and layout properties.

@LD @I { Settings{@PageMark{settings}} }
@PP
In the Settings section, you can change or add the name of the
class that will be created by typing in the 'Class Name' line
edit. Note that the default name is the form name, but it can
be changed. You can also enter text to the 'Comment' and 'Author'
line edits or leave them blank, since they are not required.

@LD @I { Pixmaps{@PageMark{pixmaps}} }
@PP
The default (for projects) is 'Project Imagefile'. This is the
recommended option. Images are handled automatically, with @I{Qt
Designer} storing the images in a subdirectory, and @F @Verbatim{uic}
producing code that contains the images and the necessary supporting
code. Each image is stored just once, no matter how many forms
it is used in.

@PP
If you do not want @I{Qt Designer} to handle the images, (or
are not using a project) choose either 'Save Inline' or 'Use
Function'. 'Save Inline' saves the pixmaps in the @F @Verbatim{.ui}
files. The disadvantage of this approach is that it stores images
in the forms in which they're used, meaning that images cannot
be shared across forms. Click 'Use Function' to use your own
icon-loader function for loading pixmaps. Type the function's
name (with no signature) in the 'Use Function' line edit. This
function will be used in the generated code for loading pixmaps.
Your function will be called with the text you put in the pixmap
property (e.g. the image name) whenever an image is required.

@LD @I { Layouts{@PageMark{layouts}} }
@PP
Click the 'Default Margin' spinbox or the 'Default Spacing' spinbox
to change the default layout settings of the current form.

@PP
To use the functions in the generated code to dynamically retrieve
values for the layout's default margin and spacing, check the
Use Functions chechbox. In the Margin and Spacing line edits,
specify the function names (no signatures or parantheses) which
should be used to retrieve the margin and spacing.

Click @B{OK} to accept changes to the form settings. Click @B{Cancel}
to leave the dialog without making any changes.

@LD @Heading { Preferences Dialog{@PageMark{preferences.dialog}} }

@PP
The 'General' tab has sections for Background, Grid, General,
and Toolbars.

@PP
The Background section defaults to 'Pixmap'. To change the default,
click the @B{Select a Pixmap} button next to the 'Pixmap' radio
button to invoke the @I{Choose a Pixmap... Dialog}. Click the
'Color' radio button to change the background to a color instead
of a pixmap. Click the @B{Choose a Color} button located to the
right of the 'Color' radio button to invoke the @I{Select Color
Dialog}.

@PP
The 'General' section of the General tab has three checkboxes
that are checked by default. Click the 'Restore last workspace
on startup' checkbox to save the size and positions of the windows
and toolbars of @I{Qt Designer}. The next time you start up @I{Qt
Designer}, the windows and toolbars are restored to their last
positions. Click the 'Show Splash Screen on startup' checkbox
to display the @I{Qt Designer} splash screen when you start up
the application. Click the 'Disable Database Auto-Edit in Preview'
checkbox to disable the ability to update or delete data in the
database to which you are connected when working with database
widgets. To change the path @I{Qt Designer} uses to find it's
online documentation, click the 'Documentation Path' line edit
and type a new path. It would be unlikely to have to change this
path. Another way to change the path is to click the @B{(ellipsis)}
button located to the right of the line edit. This invokes the
@I{Find Directory Dialog}.

@PP
The 'Grid' section has options for customizing the grid on the
form. The 'Show Grid' checkbox located above the 'Grid' section
is checked by default. Developers using @I{Qt Designer} almost
always use Qt's layouts to design their forms and rarely make
any use of the grid. The grid is provided for the rare occasions
when a form is created using widgets with fixed sizes and positions.
When 'Show Grid' is checked, you can customize the grid's appearance.
When it is unchecked, the 'Grid' section is disabled. The 'Snap
to Grid' checkbox is also checked by default. When it is checked,
widgets are placed on a dot (snap to the grid) using the X"|"Y
resolution. When it is unchecked, the 'Grid-X' and 'Grid-Y' spin
boxes are disabled. Click the 'Grid X' and 'Grid Y' spinboxes
to customize the grid settings for all forms.

syntax is viewed in the editor. Click the 'Element' listbox and
choose an element. Click the 'Family' listbox to change the font
style for that element. Click the 'Size' spinbox to choose a
font size. You can change the font to Bold, Italic, or Underline
by clicking the corresponding checkbox. Note, that all the fonts
used derive from the 'Standard' element, so if you want to change
the font used for everything, change the 'Standard' element.

Custom widgets are created in code. They may contain a combination

and signals, or they may be written from scratch, or a mixture
of both. A custom widget is often a specialization (subclass)
of another widget or a combination of widgets working together
or a blend of both these approaches. If you simply want a collection
of widgets in a particular configuration it is easiest to create
them, select them as a group, and copy and paste them as required
within @I{Qt Designer}. Custom widgets are generally created
when you need to add new functionality to existing widgets or
groups of widgets. To add create a new widget, click the @B{New
