@LP
The documentation for the Qt library is written in-line in the
@F @Verbatim{.cpp} files by the developers themselves. The documentation
team revises the documentation to ensure that it is accurate
and usable, and to provide quality control. The documentation
team also writes the larger texts, such as the class descriptions
that introduce a class along with the concepts the class uses,
as well as introducing the functions and properties that the
class provides.

@PP
The documentation focuses on the API rather than the internals,
since we make great efforts to keep our API consistent and compatible
with each new version, but we may change the internals considerably
to improve performance and enhance functionality.

@PP
The Qt Reference Documentation consists of almost 1,500 HTML
pages (over 2,500 printed pages). The overwhelming majority of
pages document Qt classes. Since developers differ in the way
they think and work we provide a variety of approaches to navigating
the documentation set:

@NumberedList 
@LI{
The All Classes page lists every class in Qt's public API, and
consists of several hundred classes.
}
@LI{
The Main Classes page lists the classes you're most likely to
use most often, and provides a much shorter and more managable
list than the All Classes list.
}
@LI{
The Grouped Classes page presents a list of groups, each of which
leads to a list of related classes, for example, the Advanced
Widgets list.
}
@LI{
The Inheritance Hierarchy page presents a list of classes in
terms of the hierarchy of Qt classes.
}
@LI{
The All Functions page lists all the functions provided by Qt
classes, each one with links to the class(es) in which it appears.
}
@EndList

No matter where you find yourself in the Qt documentation, you
will find extensive cross-referencing. Even snippets of example
code contain clickable links, so that for example, if you come
across a class declaration in a code example, the class name
will be a clickable link to the class's documentation.

@PP
In addition to the class documentation some of Qt's modules have
extensive descriptions, and there are many overview documents
which describe various aspects of the Qt library; all these are
linked from the reference documentation home page. There are
also two tutorials and numerous example programs in the examples
subdirectory of the Qt distribution.
