By default @QDR starts up with three windows on the
left hand side. They are the @Win{Project Overview} Window [p.~@PageOf{project.overview.window}], the Object
Explorer Window, and the Property Editor"/"Signal Handlers Window [p.~@PageOf{property.editor.signal.handlers.window}].
This chapter explains each window in detail.

This window lists all the files associated with the project.
To open a form or file single click it in the Files list. To
rapidly switch between forms and files, type the name of the
file in the line edit above the files list and @QDR
will perform an incremental search to show any matching files
or forms.

@PP
Right-click a file (or the project) to get a context menu of
options, for example, 'Open form' or 'Remove form from project'.

@PP
The @Win{Object Explorer} window lists the current form's widgets and
slots. The window contains two tabs, the Objects tab and the
Members tab.

Click the Widgets tab to view all the widgets for the current
form. The widgets are listed by name and class. Click a widget
in the list to highlight it in the corresponding form.

}
@LD @Heading { Members Tab{@PageMark{members.tab}} }
@PP
Click the Members tab to view the current form's slots, forward
declarations, includes, and class variables. The Members tab
uses a tree view to display its information. Items which have
a '+' sign have sub-items which are revealed by clicking the
'+'. Right click any item in the tree view to popup a context
menu.

@PP
To edit or add slots, right click the Slots folder and select
'Edit' to invoke the @Win{Edit Slots} dialog. Right click the Public,
Protected, or Private subdirectories and click 'New' to invoke
the @Win{Edit Slots} dialog. Right click a slot in the list to
invoke a menu with additional options for the slot. To add new
slots, choose 'New' from the menu, which invokes the @Win{Edit
Slots} dialog. To change the properties of the selected slot,
choose 'Properties' which invokes the @Win{Edit Slots} dialog.
To open the @Cpp editor and jump to the implementation of the
selected slot, choose 'Goto Implementation'. To remove the selected
slot, choose 'Delete'. Signals can be added or deleted in the
same way as slots.

@PP
Right click 'Forward Declarations', 'Includes (in declaration)',
'Class Variables', and 'Includes (in implementation)' to invoke
a context menu with the 'new' or 'edit' options. Choose 'New'
to invoke a line edit for typing a declaration, variable, or
include. Right click 'Forward Declarations' and choose 'Edit'
to invoke the @Win{Edit Forward Declarations} dialog. Right click
'Includes (in declaration)' and choose'Edit' to invoke the @Win{Edit
Includes (in Declaration)} dialog. Right click 'Class variables'
and choose 'Edit' to invoke the @Win{Edit Class Variables} dialog.
Right click 'Includes (in Implementation)' and choose 'Edit'
to invoke the @Win{Edit Includes (in Implementation)} dialog.

@Begin
@PP
Click the Property Editor"/"Signal Handlers window to view and
change the properties of forms, widgets and menus. This window
has a 'Properties' tab and a 'Signal Handlers' tab.

@PP
Click the 'Properties' tab to change the appearance and behaviour
of the selected widget. (For menus, click the menu bar to show
the menu item properties in the Property Editor.) The Property
Editor has two columns, the Property column which lists property
names and the Value column which lists the values. Click the
column headers to sort the properties or values. Some property
names have a plus sign '+' in a square to their left; this signifies
that the property name is the collective name for a set of related
properties.

@PP
Some properties have simple values, for example, the name property
has a text value, the width property (within minimumSize for
example) has a numeric value. To change a text value click the
existing text and type in your new text. To change a numeric
value click the value and either type in a new number, or use
the spin buttons to increase or decrease the existing number
until it reaches the value you want. Some properties have a fixed
list of values, for example the mouseTracking property is boolean
and can take the values True or False. The cursor property also
has a fixed list of values. If you click the cursor property
or the mouseTracking property the value will be shown in a drop
down combobox; click the down arrow to see what values are available.

@PP
Some properties have complex sets of values; for example the
font property. If you click the font property an ellipsis button
(...) will appear; click this button and a Select Font dialog
will pop up which you can use to change any of the font settings.
Other properties have ellipsis buttons which lead to different
dialogs depending on what settings the property can have. For
example, if you have a lot of text to enter for a text property
you could click the ellipsis button to invoke the multi-line
text editor dialog. The names of properties which have changed
are shown in bold. If you've changed a property but want to revert
it to its default value click the property's value and then click
the red 'X' button to the right of the value. Some properties
have an initial value, e.g. 'TextEdit1', but no default value;
if you revert a property that has an initial value but no default
value (by clicking the red 'X') the value will become empty unless
the property, e.g. name, is not allowed to be empty.

@PP
The property editor fully supports Undo and Redo (Ctrl+Z and
Ctrl+Y, also available from the Edit menu).
