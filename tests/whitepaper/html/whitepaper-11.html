<h2 align="center">Events</h2>
<!-- index events --><!-- index messaging --><blockquote>
<p>Qt's events perform the same role as messages on Windows: providing low-level communication. Programmers can monitor and filter events at different levels of granularity.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- index QEvent --><!-- index QObject --><p>In Qt, an event is an object that inherits <font color=darkblue><b>QEvent</b></font>. Events are delivered to <font color=darkblue><b>QObject</b></font> objects so that they can respond to them. Programmers can monitor and filter events at the application level and at the object level.</p>
<h3><a name="1"></a>Event Creation</h3>
<!-- index window system --><!-- index key presses --><!-- index mouse clicks --><!-- index resizing widgets --><!-- index wheel mouse --><p>Most events are generated by the window system and inform widgets, for example, that a key was pressed, that a mouse button was clicked or that the application window was resized. It is also possible to send simulated events to objects programmatically. There are over fifty kinds of event, of which the most interesting are <tt>MouseButtonPress</tt>, <tt>MouseButtonRelease</tt>, <tt>MouseButtonDblClick</tt>, <tt>Wheel</tt>, <tt>KeyPress</tt>, <tt>KeyRelease</tt>, <tt>Paint</tt>, <tt>Resize</tt> and <tt>Close</tt>. Developers can add their own event types that behave like the built-in types.</p>
<p>Knowing that a key was pressed or that a mouse button was released is usually not enough. The receiver also needs to know, for example, which key was pressed, which button was released or where the mouse was located. This additional information is stored in <font color=darkblue><b>QEvent</b></font> subclasses such as <font color=darkblue><b>QMouseEvent</b></font>, <font color=darkblue><b>QKeyEvent</b></font>, <font color=darkblue><b>QPaintEvent</b></font>, <font color=darkblue><b>QResizeEvent</b></font> and <font color=darkblue><b>QCloseEvent</b></font>.</p>
<h3><a name="2"></a>Event Delivery</h3>
<p>Qt delivers events by calling the virtual function <font color=darkblue>QObject::event()</font>. For convenience, <font color=darkblue>QWidget::event()</font> forwards the most common types of event to dedicated handlers, e.g. <font color=darkblue>QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent()</font>, <font color=darkblue>QWidget::keyPressEvent()</font>, etc. Developers can easily reimplement these handlers when writing their own widgets or when specializing existing widgets.</p>
<!-- index flicker --><!-- index painting --><p>Some events are sent immediately, while others are queued and are dispatched when control returns to the Qt kernel. For example, paint events are queued, and multiple paint events in the queue are compressed into a single event to minimize flicker and maximize speed.</p>
<p>Often an object needs to look at another object's events, e.g. to respond to them or to block them. This is achieved by having a monitoring object call <font color=darkblue>QObject::installEventFilter()</font> on the object that it will monitor. The monitor's <font color=darkblue>QObject::eventFilter()</font> virtual function will be called with each event that is destined for the monitored object before the monitored object receives the event.</p>
<!-- index QApplication --><p>It's also possible to filter all the application's events by installing a filter on <tt>qApp</tt>, the unique <font color=darkblue><b>QApplication</b></font> instance. Such filters are called before any widget-specific filters. It is even possible to reimplement <font color=darkblue>QApplication::notify()</font>, the event dispatcher, for complete control.</p>
