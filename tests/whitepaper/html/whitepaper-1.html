<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Qt is a C++ toolkit for cross-platform GUI and application development. In addition to the Qt C++ class library, the toolkit includes a set of tools to make writing applications fast and straightforward. Qt's cross-platform capabilities and extensive internationalization support ensure that Qt applications can reach the widest possible market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Qt C++ toolkit has been at the heart of commercial applications since 1994. Qt is used by companies as diverse as AT&amp;T, IBM, NASA and Xerox, and by numerous smaller companies and organizations. Qt 3.0 retains the ease-of-use and power of earlier versions, adds significant functionality to existing classes and introduces many new classes. Qt's classes are full-featured to reduce workload, and have consistent interfaces to speed learning. Qt is, and always has been, fully object oriented.</p>
<p>This whitepaper gives an overview of Qt's tools and functionality. Each section begins with a non-technical introduction, then presents the technical detail in increasing depth. Code extracts, and small complete applications, are presented. To experience Qt and what it can deliver, the Qt Free Edition can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">http://www.trolltech.com</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="1"></a>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Qt includes a rich set of <a href="whitepaper-2.html">Widgets</a> ('controls' in Windows terminology) that provide standard GUI functionality. Qt introduces an innovative alternative for inter-object communication, called <a href="whitepaper-3.html">Signals and Slots</a>, that replaces the old and unsafe callbacks technique. Qt also provides a conventional <a href="whitepaper-12.html">Events</a> model for handling mouse clicks, key presses, etc. Qt's cross-platform <a href="whitepaper-4.html">GUI Applications</a> can utilize all the user interface functionality required by modern applications, such as menus, context menus, dockable toolbars, balloon help, drag and drop, etc.</p>
<p>Qt's classes use intuitive naming conventions and a consistent programming approach to simplify coding. Qt also includes a visual design tool, <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a>, for designing user interfaces graphically. <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a> can be used purely as a design tool, or it can be used to create entire applications using the built-in C++ code editor.</p>
<p>Qt has excellent support for <a href="whitepaper-6.html">2D and 3D Graphics</a>. Qt is the de-facto standard GUI toolkit for platform-independent OpenGL programming.</p>
<p>Platform-independent database applications that utilize SQL databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and ODBC-compliant databases, can be created with Qt. Qt's database functionality is fully integrated with <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a>, which offers live preview of database data. Qt includes database-specific widgets, and any built-in or custom widget can be made data aware.</p>
<!-- index qmake --><p>Recompilation is all that is required to produce applications for Windows 95/98/NT4/ME/2000, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX and many other versions of Unix with X11. Qt applications can even be compiled to run on Qt/Embedded. A single source tree can be used to build applications for multiple platforms. Qt's <font color=red><b>qmake</i></font> build tool produces Makefiles or <font color=red><i>.dsp</i></font> files appropriate to the target platform. Many customers also use Qt for single-platform development on both Windows and Unix because they prefer the Qt approach.</p>
<p>Qt has considerable support for <a href="whitepaper-8.html">Internationalization</a>. Qt's use of Unicode, along with the <a href="whitepaper-9.html">Qt Linguist</a> application and other tools to support translators, means that Qt applications can be localized for almost any country in the world. Applications can easily use and mix text in Arabic, English, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian and all the other languages supported by Unicode.</p>
<p>Qt includes a variety of domain-specific classes. Qt's <a href="whitepaper-13.html#2">XML</a> module, for example, includes both SAX and DOM parsers. Qt programs have native look and feel on all supported platforms. Qt's <a href="whitepaper-10.html">Styles and Themes</a> support provides open-ended scope for look and feel customization. Inter-process communication and local and remote file handling using common protocols such as FTP and HTTP are provided by Qt's <a href="whitepaper-13.html">Input/Output and Networking</a> classes. In-memory data can be stored using Qt's <a href="whitepaper-14.html">Collection Classes</a>, which are STL compatible.</p>
<p>Qt is a mature, solid, C++ toolkit that is widely used across the world. In addition to Qt's many commercial uses, Qt is the foundation of KDE, the Linux desktop environment. Qt makes application development a pleasure, with its cross-platform build system, visual form design and elegant API.</p>
