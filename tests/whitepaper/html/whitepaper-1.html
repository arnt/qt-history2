<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Qt is a C++ toolkit for cross-platform GUI and application development. In addition to the Qt C++ class library, the toolkit includes tools to make writing applications fast and straightforward. Qt's cross-platform capabilities and extensive internationalization support ensure that Qt applications reach the widest possible market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Qt C++ toolkit has been at the heart of commercial applications since 1995. Qt is used by companies as diverse as AT&amp;T, IBM, NASA and Xerox, and by numerous smaller companies and organizations. Qt 3.0 retains the ease-of-use and power of earlier versions while adding significant functionality and introducing many new classes. Qt's classes are full-featured to reduce developer workload, and provide consistent interfaces to speed learning. Qt is, and always has been, fully object oriented.</p>
<p>This whitepaper gives an overview of Qt's tools and functionality. Each section begins with a non-technical introduction, then presents the technical details in increasing depth. Code extracts, and small complete applications, are presented. To trial Qt for 30 days, visit <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">http://www.trolltech.com</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="1"></a>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Qt includes a rich set of <a href="whitepaper-2.html">Widgets</a> ('controls' in Windows terminology) that provide standard GUI functionality. Qt introduces an innovative alternative for inter-object communication, called <a href="whitepaper-3.html">Signals and Slots</a>, that replaces the old and unsafe callback technique. Qt also provides a conventional <a href="whitepaper-11.html">Events</a> model for handling mouse clicks, key presses, etc. Qt's cross-platform <a href="whitepaper-4.html">GUI Applications</a> can use all the user interface functionality required by modern applications, such as menus, context menus, dockable toolbars, balloon help, drag and drop, etc.</p>
<p>Intuitive naming conventions and a consistent programming approach simpify coding. Qt also includes <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a>, a tool for designing user interfaces graphically. <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a> supports Qt's powerful <a href="whitepaper-10.html">Layouts</a> in addition to absolute positioning. <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a> can be used purely as a design tool, or it can be used to create entire applications with the built-in C++ code editor.</p>
<p>Qt has excellent support for <a href="whitepaper-6.html">2D and 3D Graphics</a>. Qt is the de-facto standard GUI toolkit for platform-independent OpenGL programming.</p>
<p>Qt makes it possible to create platform-independent database applications using standard <a href="whitepaper-7.html">Databases</a>. Qt includes native drivers for Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and ODBC-compliant databases. Qt's database functionality is fully integrated with <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a>, which offers live preview of database data. Qt includes database-specific widgets, and any built-in or custom widget can be made data aware.</p>
<!-- index qmake --><p>Qt programs have native look and feel on all supported platforms using Qt's <a href="whitepaper-9.html">Styles and Themes</a> support. From a single source tree, recompilation is all that is required to produce applications for Windows 95/98/NT4/ME/2000, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX and many other versions of Unix with X11. Qt applications can even be compiled to run on Qt/Embedded. Qt's <font color=red><b>qmake</i></font> build tool produces Makefiles or <font color=red><i>.dsp</i></font> files appropriate to the target platform. Since <a href="whitepaper-15.html">Qt's Architecture</a> takes advantage of the underlying platform, many customers also use Qt for single-platform development on both Windows and on Unix because they prefer the Qt approach.</p>
<p>Qt uses Unicode throughout and has considerable support for <a href="whitepaper-8.html">Internationalization</a>. Qt includes <a href="whitepaper-8.html#6">Qt Linguist</a> and other tools to support translators. Applications can easily use and mix text in Arabic, English, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian and all the other languages supported by Unicode.</p>
<p>Qt includes a variety of domain-specific classes. For example, Qt has an <a href="whitepaper-12.html#2">XML</a> module that includes SAX and DOM parsers. Objects can be stored in memory using Qt's STL-compatible <a href="whitepaper-13.html">Collection Classes</a>. Local and remote file handling using standard protocols are provided by Qt's <a href="whitepaper-12.html">Input/Output and Networking</a> classes.</p>
<p>Qt applications can have their functionality extended by <a href="whitepaper-14.html">Plugins and Dynamic Libraries</a>. Plugins provide additional codecs, database drivers, image formats, styles and widgets. Libraries can offer an unlimited range of functionality. Plugins and libraries can be sold as products in their own right.</p>
<p>Qt is a mature, solid C++ toolkit that is widely used across the world. In addition to Qt's many commercial uses, the free edition of Qt is the foundation of KDE, the Linux desktop environment. Qt makes application development a pleasure, with its cross-platform build system, visual form design and elegant API.</p>
