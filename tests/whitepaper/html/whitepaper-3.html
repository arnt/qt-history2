<h2 align="center">Signals and Slots</h2>
<!-- index signal --><!-- index slot --><blockquote>
<p>Signals and slots provide inter-object communication. They are easy to understand and use and are fully supported by <a href="whitepaper-5.html">Qt Designer</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GUI applications respond to user actions. For example, when a user clicks a menu item or toolbar button, the program executes some code. More generally, we want objects of any kind to be able to communicate with each other. The programmer must relate events to the relevant code. Older toolkits use mechanisms that are not type safe (i.e. are crash prone), are inflexible, and are not object oriented. Trolltech has invented a solution called 'signals and slots'. Signals and slots is a powerful inter-object communication mechanism that can be used to completely replace the crude callbacks and message maps used by legacy toolkits. Signals and slots are type safe, flexible, fully object oriented and implemented in C++.</p>
<p>To associate some code with a button using the old callback mechanism, it is necessary to pass a pointer to a function to the button. When the button is clicked, the function is then called. Old toolkits do not ensure that arguments of the right type are given to the function when it is called, which makes crashes more likely. Another problem with the callback approach is that it tightly binds the GUI element to the functionality, making it difficult to develop classes independently.</p>
<p>Qt's signals and slots mechanism is different. Qt widgets emit signals when events occur. For example, a button will emit a 'clicked' signal when it is clicked. The programmer can choose to connect to a signal by creating a function (called a slot) and calling the <font color=darkblue>connect()</font> function to relate the signal to the slot. Qt's signals and slots mechanism does not require classes to have knowledge of each other, which makes it much easier to develop highly reusable classes. Signals and slots are type safe, with type errors being reported by the compiler rather than by crashes.</p>
<!-- index MFC --><!-- index Motif --><!-- index QObject --><!-- index callbacks --><!-- index communication --><!-- index message maps --><!-- index objects --><!-- index signals --><!-- index slots --><!-- index events --><!-- index state of widgets --><!-- index connect() --><p>For example, if a <font color=darkgreen><em>Quit</em></font> button's <font color=darkblue>clicked()</font> signal is connected to the application's <font color=darkblue>quit()</font> slot, a user's click on <font color=darkgreen><em>Quit</em></font> makes the application terminate. In code, this is written as</p>
<pre>
    connect( button, SIGNAL(clicked()), qApp, SLOT(quit()) );
</pre>
<p>Connections can be added or removed at any time during the execution of a Qt application.</p>
<!-- index OOP --><!-- index object-oriented programming --><!-- index type safety --><p>The signals and slots implementation smoothly extends C++'s syntax and takes full advantage of C++'s object-orientated features. Signals and slots are type safe, can be overloaded or reimplemented and may appear in the public, protected or private sections of a class.</p>
<!-- index components --><!-- index reusability --><h3><a name="1"></a>A Signals and Slots Example</h3>
<!-- index QObject --><p>To benefit from signals and slots, a class must inherit from <font color=darkblue><b>QObject</b></font> or one of its subclasses and include the <tt>Q_OBJECT</tt> macro in the class's definition. Signals are declared in the <tt>signals</tt> section of the class, while slots are declared in the <tt>public</tt> <tt>slots</tt>, <tt>protected</tt> <tt>slots</tt> or <tt>private</tt> <tt>slots</tt> sections.</p>
<!-- index inheriting in Qt --><!-- index subclassing in Qt --><p>Here's an example <font color=darkblue><b>QObject</b></font> subclass:</p>
<pre>
    class BankAccount : public QObject
    {
	Q_OBJECT
    public:
	BankAccount() { curBalance = 0; }
	int balance() const { return curBalance; }
    public slots:
	void setBalance( int newBalance );

    signals:
	void balanceChanged( int newBalance );

    private:
	int curBalance;
    };
</pre>
<p>In the style of most C++ classes, the class <font color=darkblue><b>BankAccount</b></font> has a constructor, a get function <font color=darkblue>balance()</font>, and a set function <font color=darkblue>setBalance()</font>.</p>
<p>The class also has a signal <font color=darkblue>balanceChanged()</font>, which announces that the balance in the account has changed. Signals are not implemented; when a signal is emitted, the slots it is connected to are executed.</p>
<p>The set function is declared in the <tt>public</tt> <tt>slots</tt> section, so it is a slot. Slots are standard member functions with an implementation that can be called like any other function, and which can also be connected to signals.</p>
<!-- index emitting a signal --><!-- index preprocessor (C++) --><p>Here's the implementation of the slot <font color=darkblue>setBalance()</font>:</p>
<pre>
    void BankAccount::setBalance( int newBalance )
    {
	if ( newBalance != curBalance ) {
	    curBalance = newBalance;
	    emit balanceChanged( curBalance );
	}
    }
</pre>
<p>The statement</p>
<pre>
    emit balanceChanged( curBalance );
</pre>
<p>causes the <font color=darkblue>balanceChanged()</font> signal to be emitted with the new current balance as its argument. The keyword <tt>emit</tt>, like <tt>signals</tt> and <tt>slots</tt>, is provided by Qt and is transformed into standard C++ by the C++ preprocessor.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to connect two <font color=darkblue><b>BankAccount</b></font>s:</p>
<pre>
    BankAccount x, y;
    connect( &amp;x, SIGNAL(balanceChanged(int)),
	     &amp;y, SLOT(setBalance(int)) );
    x.setBalance( 2450 );
</pre>
<p>When the balance in <tt>x</tt> is set to 2450, the <font color=darkblue>balanceChanged()</font> signal is emitted. The signal is received by <tt>y</tt>'s <font color=darkblue>setBalance()</font> slot, which sets <tt>y</tt>'s balance to 2450.</p>
<p>One object's signal can be connected to many different slots, and many signals can be connected to one slot in a particular object. Connections can be made between any signal and slot, provided that their arguments are compatible.</p>
<h3><a name="2"></a>Meta Object Compiler</h3>
<!-- index Meta Object Compiler --><!-- index compiler features --><!-- index header files --><!-- index moc --><!-- index qmake --><p>The signals and slots mechanism is implemented in pure standard C++. The implementation uses the C++ preprocessor and the Meta Object Compiler (<font color=red><b>moc</i></font>) included with the Qt toolkit.</p>
<p>The <font color=red><b>moc</i></font> reads the application's header files and generates the necessary code to support the signals and slots mechanism. Developers never have to edit or even look at the generated code. The <font color=red><b>qmake</i></font> build tool generates the correct Makefiles for the target platform.</p>
<!-- index introspection --><!-- index magic --><!-- index properties --><!-- index rtti --><!-- index run-time type information --><!-- index translations --><p>In addition to handling signals and slots, <font color=red><b>moc</i></font> supports Qt's translation mechanism, its property system and extended run-time type information. The <font color=red><b>moc</i></font> also makes the cross-platform introspection of C++ programs possible.</p>
