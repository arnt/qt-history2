This whitepaper describes the Qt C++ toolkit. Qt supports the
development of cross-platform GUI applications with its `write once,
compile anywhere' approach. Using a single source tree and a simple
recompilation, applications can be written for
Windows~"95/98/NT4/ME/2000", Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX and many
other versions of Unix with X11. Qt applications can also be compiled
to run on "Qt/Embedded". Qt introduces a unique inter-object
communication mechanism called `signals and slots'. Qt has excellent
support for many programming domains: 2D and 3D graphics,
internationalization, XML, etc. Qt applications can be built visually
using @QDR.
