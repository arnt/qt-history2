Qt fully supports Unicode, the international standard character set.
Programmers can freely mix Arabic, English, Hebrew, Japanese,
Russian, and every other language supported by Unicode, in their
applications. Qt also includes tools to support application
translation to help companies reach international markets.
} }
@PP
Qt includes tools to facilitate the translation process. Programmers
can easily mark user-visible text that needs translation, and a tool
extracts this text from the source code. @QDR is an
easy-to-use GUI application that reads the extracted source texts,
and provides the texts with context information ready for
translation. When the translation is complete, Qt Linguist
outputs a translation file for use by application programs. Qt
Linguist's documentation provides the relevant information for
release managers, translators and programmers.

@PP
Qt uses the @Class QString class to store Unicode strings, and
uses it throughout the API and internally. @Class QString replaces the
crude @F {const char *} and the 16-bit @Class QChar class replaces @F
char. Constructors and operators are provided to automatically convert
to and from 8-bit strings. Programmers can copy @Class {QString}s by
value, since they are implicitly shared (copy on write)
@Xref{collection.classes}, which makes them fast and memory efficient.
qchar @Index { QChar }
qregexp @Index { QRegExp }
qstring @Index { QString }
unicode @Index { Unicode }
char @Index { Char }

strings @Index { Strings }
@PP
@Class QString is more than a 16-bit character string. Functions such
as @Func QChar::lower() and @Func QChar::isPunct() replace @Func
tolower() and @Func ispunct() and work over the whole Unicode range.
Qt's regular expression engine, provided by the @Class QRegExp class,
uses Unicode strings both for the regular expression pattern and the
target string.

#Items in widget classes such as @Class QListBox and @Class QTable can

@PP
Conversion to and from different encodings and charsets is handled by
@Class QTextCodec subclasses. Qt uses @Class QTextCodec for fonts,
input methods and "I/O"; programmers can use it for their own purposes
as well.
qtextcodec @Index { QTextCodec }

@PP
Qt 3.0 supports 37 different encodings, including Big5 and GBK for
Chinese, EUC-JP, JIS and Shift-JIS for Japanese, KOI8-R for Russian
and the ISO 8859 series; see 
@Href{"http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextcodec.html"} for the complete list.
Programmers can add their own encodings by providing a charmap or by
subclassing @Class QTextCodec.

Qt provides a powerful text-rendering engine for all text that is
displayed on screen, from the simplest label to the most
sophisticated rich-text editor. The engine supports advanced features
such as special line breaking behavior, bidirectional writing and
diacritical marks. It renders most of the world's writing systems,
including Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, English, Greek, Hebrew,
Japanese, Korean, Latin, Thai and Vietnamese. Qt will automatically
combine the installed fonts to render multi-language text.

Far-Eastern writing systems require many more characters than are
available on a keyboard. The conversion from a sequence of key
presses to actual characters is performed at the window-system level
by software called `input methods'. Qt automatically supports the
installed input methods.

@PP
Qt provides tools and functions to help developers provide
applications in their customers' native languages.
texttranslation @Index { Text translation }
translation @Index { Translation }
@PP
To make a string translatable, simply wrap it in a call to @Func tr()
(read 'translate'):
tr @Index { tr() }
@IndentedDisplay @CP @Begin
saveButton->setText( tr("Save") );
@End @CP
@Func tr() attempts to replace a string literal (e.g. @F "Save") with
a translation if one is available; otherwise it uses the original
text. English can be used as the source language and Chinese as the
translated language, or vice versa. The argument to @Func tr() is
converted to Unicode from the application's default encoding.
@PP
@Func tr()'s general syntax is
qobject @Index { QObject }
commentsfortranslation) @Index { Comments (for translation) } 
contextsfortranslation) @Index { Contexts (for translation) }
sourcetexts @Index { Source texts }
@IndentedDisplay @CP @Begin
Context::tr("source text", "comment")
@End @CP
The `context' is the name of a @Class QObject subclass. It is
usually omitted, in which case the class containing the @Func tr()
call is used as the context. The `source text' is the text to
translate. The `comment' is optional; along with the context, it
provides additional information to human translators.
@PP
Translations are stored in @Class QTranslator objects, which use
disk-based @File .qm files (Qt Message files). Each @File .qm file contains
the translations for a particular language. The language can be
chosen at run-time, in accordance with the locale or user
preferences.
.qm @Index { .qm }
qtranslator @Index { QTranslator }
locales @Index { Locales }
@PP
Qt provides three tools for preparing @File .qm files: @Cmd lupdate, 
Qt Linguist and @Cmd lrelease.
linguist @Index { Linguist }
qtlinguist @Index { Qt Linguist }
lrelease @Index { lrelease }
lupdate @Index { lupdate }
@PP
@NumberedList
designer @Index { Designer }
qtdesigner @Index { Qt Designer }
.ts @Index { .ts }
.ui @Index { .ui }
xml @Index { XML }
@ListItem { @Cmd lupdate extracts all the (context, source text,
comment) triples from the source code, including @QDR
@File .ui files, and generates a @File .ts file (Translation Source
file). @File .ts files are in human-readable XML format. }
@ListItem { Translators use Qt Linguist to provide translations
for the source texts in the @File .ts files. }
@ListItem { Highly compressed @File .qm files are generated by running
@Cmd lrelease on the @File .ts files. }
@EndList
These steps are repeated as often as necessary during the lifetime of
an application. It is perfectly safe to run @Cmd lupdate frequently,
as it reuses existing translations and marks translations for
obsolete source texts without eliminating them. @Cmd lupdate also
detects slight changes in source texts and automatically suggests
appropriate translations. These translations are marked as unfinished
so that a translator can easily check them.
@PP
Qt itself contains about 400 user-visible strings, for which
Trolltech provides French and German translations.
french @Index { French }
german @Index { German }

@PP
Qt Linguist is a Qt application that helps translators translate
Qt applications.
@Figure
    @Caption { Qt Linguist }
@Scale @IncludeGraphic { "../images/linguist-wp.eps" }
@PP
Translators can edit @File .ts files by hand, or more conveniently
using Qt Linguist. The @File .ts file's contexts are listed in
the left-hand side of the application's window. The list of source
texts for the current context is displayed in the top-right area,
along with translations. By selecting a source text, the translator
can enter a translation for it, mark it as done or unfinished, and
proceed to the next unfinished translation. Keyboard shortcuts are
provided for all the common navigation options: @Menu {"Done & Next"},
@Menu {Next Unfinished}, etc. The user interface's dockable windows
can be reorganized to suit the translators' preferences.
@PP
Applications often use the same phrases many times in different
source texts. Qt Linguist automatically displays intelligent
guesses based on previously translated strings and predefined
translations at the bottom of the window. Guesses often serve as a
good starting point that helps translators translate similar texts
consistently. Qt Linguist can optionally validate translations
to ensure that accelerators and ending punctuation are translated
correctly.
