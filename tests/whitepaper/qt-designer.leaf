\QUOTE
\QD is written in Qt and provides visual user-interface design. Qt
applications can be written entirely as source code, or using \QD
to speed up development.

  \caption \QD

Designing a form with \QD is a simple process. Developers click a
toolbar button representing the widget they want, then click on a
form to place the widget. The widget's properties can then be changed
using the property editor. The precise positions and sizes of the
widgets does not matter. Developers select widgets and apply layouts
to them. For example, some button widgets could be selected and laid
out side-by-side by choosing the 'lay out horizontally' option. This
approach makes design very fast, and the finished forms will scale
properly to fit whatever window size the end-user prefers. See \l
Layouts for information about Qt's automatic layouts.

  \index Database

\QD eliminates the time-consuming compile, link and run cycle for user
interface design. This makes it easy to correct or change designs.
\QD's preview options let developers see their forms in any style, for
example, a Windows developer can preview a form in Motif style. \QD
provides live preview and editing of database data through its tight
integration with Qt's database classes. See \l Databases for more
about Qt's database support.

  \index Custom widget

Developers can create both `dialog' style applications and `main
window' style applications with menus, toolbars, balloon help, etc.

Several form templates are supplied, and developers can create their
own templates to ensure consistency across an application or family of
applications. \QD uses wizards to make creating toolbars, menus and
database applications as fast and easy as possible. Programmers can
create their own custom widgets that can easily be integrated with
\QD.

  \index .pro
  \index Inheriting
  \index Makefile
  \index Subclassing
  \index qmake

\QD supports a project-based approach to application development. A
project is represented by a \File .pro file, which \Cmd qmake can use
to generate Makefiles. Developers create a new project and then add
forms and source files as required. Developers can completely separate
the user interface from the underlying functionality by subclassing,
or they can keep their source code and forms together by editing the
form's source directly in \QD.

Icons and other images used in the application are automatically
shared across all forms in a project to reduce executable size and
speed up loading.

  \index .ui
  \index XML
  \index uic

Form designs are stored in XML format in \File .ui files and
converted into C++ header and source files by the \Cmd uic (User
Interface Compiler). The \Cmd qmake build tool automatically
includes build rules for \Cmd uic in the Makefiles it generates, so
developers do not need to invoke \Cmd uic themselves.

Usually forms are compiled into the executable, but in some
situations customers need to modify the appearance of an application
without accessing the source code. Qt supports 'dynamic dialogs':
\File .ui files that can be loaded at run-time and dynamically
converted into fully functional forms. Companies can supply
application executables along with the customer-modifiable forms in
\File .ui format, and the customer can use \QD to customize the
appearance of the application's forms. Loading a dynamic dialog is
trivial:
\code
    QDialog *creditForm = (QDialog *)
			  QWidgetFactory::create( "creditform.ui" );
\endcode

\QD's on-line help is provided by the \e {Qt Assistant} application.
\e {Qt Assistant} displays Qt's entire documentation set, and works
in a similar way to a web browser. Unlike web browsers, \e {Qt
Assistant} applies an intelligent indexing algorithm to provide fast
searching for words and phrases that occur in the documentation.

  \index Reference documentation

Qt's reference documentation consists of around 1,500 HTML pages (over
2,500 US letter sized pages), which document Qt's classes and tools,
and which include overviews and introductions to various aspects of Qt
programming.

  \index Custom tag
  \index HTML
  \index QStyleSheet
  \index QTextEdit

\e {Qt Assistant} is a Qt application that renders Qt's HTML
reference documentation using \Class QTextEdit. The \Class QTextEdit
class supports a subset of HTML 3.2, and can also use custom tags
that are created with the \Class QStyleSheet class.

\section1 GUI Application Example

  \img hierarchy.png
  \caption Class hierarchy application

The class hierarchy application is a classic 'dialog' style application
where the user chooses some options, in this case paths, and then
carries out some processing based on those options.

The complete code for the application is presented below. The
\File{main.cpp} file was produced by a \QD wizard. The form was
designed in \QD and stored in a @File .ui file. The \File .ui file is
converted into C++ by \Cmd uic, leaving the developer free to focus on
the application's functionality.

The \Func addSearchPath(), \Func removeSearchPath() and \Func
updateHierarchy() functions are all slots. They have been visually
connected to the appropriate buttons using \l {Qt Designer}.
