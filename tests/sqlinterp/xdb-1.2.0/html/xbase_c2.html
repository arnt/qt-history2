<TITLE>Xbase DBMS Chapter 2</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>
<H2><p align="center">Database Overview</p></H2>
<p align="center">Chapter Updated 2/1/99</p><hr>

The objective of this chapter is to provide information regarding how 
the database files are utilized and document the various record structures.  
With the exception of the brief section on the record buffer, the 
information presented in this chapter is not required to use the 
Xbase library. It is mainly information describing internal file 
structures utilized by the Xbase routines.<br><br>

Xbase files are comprised of a variable length header record which stores
information about the file and describes
the fixed length record format, followed by a series of fixed length 
data records.
<br><br>

Each fixed length data record is preceded by a one byte indicator
which identifiies if the record has been deleted.  If the record is
not deleted, the indicator is a space (0x20). If deleted, the
indicator contains an asterisk (0x2A).  Data fields are stored in records
without field separators or record terminators.<br><br>

In earlier releases of dBASE, there is an ASCII NULL character
between the $0D end of header indicator and the start of the data.
This NULL was removed starting with dBASE III Plus, making a Plus
header one byte shorter than an identically structured III file.
The methods documented in the Xbase software and documentation follow 
the more recent version where the NULL character is not included.
<br><br>

Each database file is comprised of zero, one or many records.  A record is
comprised of fields.  Only one record is accessed at a time.<br><br>

Zero, one or many database files can be open simultaneously.<br><br>

<h3>The Record Buffer</h3>

When using the Xbase routines, each open data file has a record buffer 
which is manipulated by calling the database, index and field routines.

Updates are committed from the record buffer to the database when a write,
or append is performed.  The library will automatically write updates
to the database if the buffer has been updated and the record is 
repositioned or the database is closed.<br><br>

The record buffer is not used for handling the actual data portion of 
memo fields.  When working with memo fields, the application program must
allocate enough buffer space for reading and writing memo fields.<br><br>

Internal to the library, there is an additional record buffer which
stores the original value of the data record before any changes are made.
This is used by the index routines for finding and deleting original key
values from any open indices before adding the new keys. If the key values
are not changed, no index updates occur.

<h3>Xbase Database File Header</h3>

The Xbase file header, located at the beginning of the database, describes 
the .DBF database.  Knowledge of this structure is not necessary to 
effectively utilize the Xbase libraries.<br><br><br>

<h3>Xbase Field Descriptor Record</h3>
The Xbase field descriptor record stores information about each field in the
database.  Each database has from 1 to 1024 fields.  
Knowledge of this structure is not necessary to 
effectively utilize the Xbase libraries.<br><br><br>

<h3>Field Data Format</h3>
Data are stored in ASCII format in the database as follows:<br><br>

<h3>Memo Fields</h3>

Memo fields store variable length data elements in a seperate .DBT file.
The main .DBF file maintains a ten byte field which is used by the Xbase
routines for determining the location of the data in the .DBT file.
<br><br>

Xbase DBMS supports both dBASE III+ and dBASE IV version memo files.
The version IV files are somewhat more efficient in that they reuse
unused memo space when data are deleted or freed from use.  With version
III files, all new updates are appended to the end of the file and the 
unused space is not reclaimed until the datafiles are packed.
<br><br>

Memo fields can be used for storing a variety of date type.  However,
type 3 files are limited to storing textual data because most internal
memo field processing in a type 3 file relies on two contiguous 0x1a
charaters.  <br><br>

Type 4 memo fields can be used for storing BLOB (binary large object)
data reliably, as the internal file structure does not rely on any 
special characters embedded in the data.<br><br>

A special not on storing string data in a memo field.  For those users
that are new to C/C++ programming,  string fields typically end with 
a null (0x00) terminator character. As a general rule of thumb when using
the library, add one to the length of any string when
specifying the length of the data.  This stores the null terminating byte
with the data.  For example, when storing string "This is a string"
specified size if 17, not 16. 
 

<h4>Technical memo file information</h4>

The following info on memo fields is for the curious.
It is not required
reading if you don't need to know the internals.<br><br>

<li>Memo files are made up of one or more blocks
<li>For version III files, the block size is 512
<li>For version IV files, the block size is a multiple of 512
<li>The minimum amout of space necessary to store one memo field is one block
or 512 bytes.
<li>The default block size can be adjusted by manipulating the 
XB_DBT_BLOCK_SIZE macro in the options.h file.


<li>The main .DBF file maintains a ten byte numeric field which is blank if 
no memo data exists for a given field. Otherwise it contains a number, which
when multiplied by the block size, points to the offset in the file of the head 
block in the file/
<br><br>

For version 3 memo field files, there are two fields in the head block of
the file, <em>NextBlockNo</em> and <em>Version</em>.  Depending on the 
Xbase software, some vendors products update these two fields, some do not.
The Xbase library keeps the fields updated, but does not rely on them to
be valued with correct data.  This helps to support maximum compatibility
amoungst all Xbase tools available.<br><br>

For version 4 memo field files,
the first block in the .DBT file is a header block which is comprised of
8 bytes of data which maintain the file's block size and the next free
block available in the file.  Blocks two through n contain the actual
memo data.
A chain of empty blocks is 
maintained within the file for potential
future use.  When an add or update routine executes, it first attempts to 
find a spot
in a set of blocks which were earlier allocated, but not currently in use
for the data. 
If no free spot is found, data are appended to the end of the file.

The free block chain is sorted in 
block number order.  When blocks of
data are freed and added to the free block chain, the routines will attempt
to concatonate free block chains togethor where possible. When a delete
occurs, or an update which requires less space occurs, the new free space 
is added to the free block chain.
