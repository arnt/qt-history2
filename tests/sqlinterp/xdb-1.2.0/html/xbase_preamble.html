Last Updated 2/11/99<br>Version 1.8.0a</p></H1>

Welcome to Xbase DBMS.  This product provides C and C++ programmers a
powerful class library for manipulating Xbase type database files and indices.

This project originated as <em>Xbase for Linux</em>, but thanks to support
for the library by many programmers on platforms other than Linux, it has
been renamed to <em>Xbase DBMS</em>.

The main development of this library however,
remains on the Linux platform utilizing the GCC public domain C/C++ compiler.

<br><br>
XBase DBMS is a cross-platform development tool and currently includes 
routines to support multi-user access
for .DBF databases, fields, Dbase III and IV memo fields 
(variable length fields), dates, record and file locking and .NDX 
indices.
As of release 1.7.4c, Xbase is compatible with dBASE III database, indices,
and memo fields and has some support for dBASE IV features.  

<br><br>
There is an HTML user interface class which works well with the Apache 
Web Server.  Future releases will support filters, enhanced .MDX index files, 
transaction support, a client server configuration, secure data options and 
other enhancements requested by anyone using this library.

<br><br>
If you are looking for database libraries in general, or need access to 
Xbase files in particular, give Xbase DBMS a try.
If you are a C programmer and new to C++ object oriented programming, Xbase 
for Linux is easy to learn and will help transition you to the world of 
object oriented programming. If you have never programmed in "C/C++" before, 
this library should provide complete enough examples to get you started
programming in "C/C++" with confidence.<br><br><br>
