<BR>Please send suggestions, bug reports, patches, etc. one of these email
adresses.
<H2>Language</H2>
<P>Perl 5.0</P>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>Convert Dbase, Clipper, FOXPRO Source Code to XBASE C++ Code for use with
<A HREF="http://www.startech.keller.tx.us/xbase.html">Gary Kunkel's XBASE DBMS Library</A></P>
<H2>Output</H2>
<P>.cpp File and .h File</P>
<H2>Arguments</H2>
<P>1st arg = filename</P>
<H2>Remarks</H2>
<P>The script tries to keep track of the databases used in different workareas.
But the flow through your program cannot be determined, so in some cases
you have to help the script a bit by giving additional info.</P>
<P>Three special comments have been designed to add this info:</P>
<PRE>* XB2CPP(SelectedArea)
or&nbsp; * XB2CPP(SelectedArea,Workarea1,Alias1,Wa2,Al2...)
or&nbsp; * XB2CPP(SelA,WA1,Al1[Total1, Active1],Wa2, Al2[Tot2,Act2])</PRE>
<P>e.g. * XB2CPP(3,3,ZP,2,PL) will inform the script for example at the beginning
of a PROCEDURE that a database with Alias ZP is opened in workarea 3 and
a database with alias PL is opened in workarea2 and when calling this procedure
always workarea 3 is selected.</P>
<P>The third alternative of this statement makes it possible to define
the number of open indices and which one is the active index, as given
by a previous SET INDEX TO or USE and SET ORDER TO statements. The script
cannot know, which procedures, statements have been executed before and
opened indices.... So * XB2CPP(2,2,ZP[2,1]) will inform the script about
an open database alias ZP in workarea 2 which is currently selected and
has two open indices where the first one is the active one.</P>
<H2>Hints</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Always give an ALIAS in USE-Statements this is needed for generation
of the Database Classnames</LI>
<LI>Give the above described additional infos where necessary.</LI>
<LI>Use ALIASes in Expressions with database fields, this helps the script
in knowing where database references are.</LI>
<LI>Replace the XXX in PutXXXField or GetXXXField manually the script is
not able to determine variable or field types. The code for getting a Textfield
(GetField) must also be corrected. Xbase DBMS Syntax requires the buffer
as second parameter, the string will not be returned ! You may use a C++
String wrapper for this job.</LI>
<LI>PROCEDURES that will operate on two different databases where some statements
are used for both cannot be converted The script needs to know everytime
on which database the statements are operating. Either duplicate such procedures,
(one for each database), or write a generic C++ routine with pointers to
databases.</LI>
<LI>Don't assume any compilable or even working C++ source code as output.
The ambigous DBASE language, which lacks type and variable definitions
is one reason for this. This script only will help you for about 10-30%
of the conversion. The rest (which remained uppercase) has to be done manually
:)</LI>
