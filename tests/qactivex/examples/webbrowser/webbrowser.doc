  \title A Web Browser


  This example utilizes the Microsoft Web Browser ActiveX control 
  to implement a fully functional Web Browser application. The
  user interface has been developed using the QAxWidget Designer
  integration, and simple signal and slots connections handle most
  of the user interaction.

  The code demonstrates the use of signals and slots to embed
  ActiveX controls using the QAxWidget container class, and the
  dynamicCall function.

  To build the example you must first build the
  \link module-qaxcontainer.html QAxContainer \endlink library.
  Then run your make tool in \c examples/webbrowser and
  run the resulting \c webbrowser.exe.
