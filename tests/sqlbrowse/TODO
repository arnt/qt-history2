General SQL TODO stuff:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allow QSqlIndex or QSqlCursor to maintain an additional property:
something like isAutoNumbered() which would indicate whether the
backend auto-numbers the primary index field for a table.  Data-aware
controls can then determine if this is the case, and query the backend
for the new-autonumbered field value on an insert.  This will allow
accurate relocation to a newly inserted record in a QDataTable or
QDataBrowse.


Optimize local data caching.  Using QValueList<QValueList<QVariant>>
is probably not the fastest and most memory efficient approach.
