    \quickclass QAssistantClient
    \brief The QAssistantClient class provides a means of using Qt Assistant as an application's help tool.

    Using Qt Assistant is simple: Create a QAssistantClient instance,
    then call showPage() as often as necessary to show your help
    pages. When you call showPage(), Qt Assistant will be launched if
    it isn't already running.

    The QAssistantClient instance can open (openAssistant()) or close
    (closeAssistant()) Qt Assistant whenever required. If Qt Assistant
    is open, the \c open property is true.

    One QAssistantClient instance interacts with one Qt Assistant
    instance, so every time you call openAssistant(), showPage() or
    closeAssistant() they are applied to the particular Qt Assistant
    instance associated with the QAssistantClient.

    When you call openAssistant() the assistantOpened() signal is
    emitted. Similarly when closeAssistant() is called,
    assistantClosed() is emitted. In either case, if an error occurs,
    error() is emitted.

    This class is only available if your C++ application was linked
    against \c libqassistantclient.so (Unix) or \c
    qassistantclient.lib (Windows), which is built into \c INSTALL/lib
    if you built the Qt tools (\c INSTALL is the directory where Qt is
    installed).

    assistant.book Qt Assistant manual\endlink.
