This directory contains (a faint shadow of) Turbo Vision interface
for Xbase library.

Turbo Vision is a powerful class library that provides best of breed
text mode interface with SAA/CUA flavor.  Turbo Vision is copyrighted
by (former) Borland Intl.

This code corresponds to Turbo Vision version 2 for DOS, which can be
found at

	ftp.borland.com/pub/borlandcpp/devsupport/archive/turbovision/tv.zip

However, it works great with TurboVision for Unix (0.6 -- or any other
at your option).  This port is (c) Sergio Sigala and can be found at

	ftp.vix.com/guests/ssigala/pub/tvision


Comments and complaints are welcome.

To do:

 o  Index support.  RecNo-based addressing is hammered into TListViewer.
    May require great rewrite.
 o  Horizontal scrolling.
 o  Locked (non-scrollable) columns.
 o  Nontrivial memo field handling.
 o  In-place editing.
 o  Documentation

Wanted:

 o  More testing (DOS/Windows or BSD)
 o  Better idea for demo app (maybe bin/dbfutil.cpp ?)

  Regards,
  Willy.
