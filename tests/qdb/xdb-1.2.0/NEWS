XDB Version 1.2.0 (May 29, 2000)
--------------------------------

Fixed bugs introduced in 1.0.0 (with the exception of NTX index problems
which haven't been fixed yet).

Addition of support for variable node sizes to NDX indexes.  The default
node size for dBase NDX files is 512 bytes.  Increasing the node size
allows more keys to fit in a given node and can increase performance
on larger tables.  Use the SetNodeSize() method of an index to set
the node size before creation of the index, for example:

    ndx->SetNodeSize(2048);
    
sets the node size to 2048.  Valid node sizes are from 512-4096 in
512 byte increments.  Once the NDX index is created, the node size
is determined automatically.

Various bugfixes to the expression parsing/evaluation code including
the addition (enabling?) of the logical operators .AND., .OR. and .NOT..

Modified the GetFieldNo() method of xbDbf to do a non-case-sensitive
comparsion to support NDX files created by the real dBase program.


XDB Version 1.0.0 (Feb 4, 2000)
-------------------------------

Many bugfixes.  Most notable being fixes to the locking code to allow
actual multi-user access and the use of a binary search instead of a
linear search for key values within NDX nodes.

Addition of code to support "real" deletes.  The normal behavior for
dBase files is to mark records as deleted, but they remain in the
database (and indexes) until the database is "packed" and reindexed.  
XDB now supports actual delete and reuse of deleted records (i.e. deleted
records no longer appear in the database and are removed from indexes
when deleted).  The default behavior is still the dBase behavior; however
you can use the RealDeleteOn() method of the xbDbf class to enable 
real deletes.  Note that real deletes should be "turned on" before
creation the database and each time the database is opened to work
correctly.

The following is the NEWS file from the original xBase1.8.1 release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All includes moved to xbase/ directory.  From now on, use:

	#include <xbase/xbase.h>

Release 1.8.0b release 2/27/99

Has some misc bug fixes from release 1.8.0a, mainly includes a missing
configure script.  

1.8.0b was released to address misc 1.8.0a distribution problems,
because applying additional mods to the code base.

The NTX index logic is still in alpha.  It does not appear to generate
correct indices in all circumstances.  So for now, you may want to 
continue using the NDX indices.


Release 1.8.0a  Significant enhancements

1)  Exception processing
2)  GNU Autoconf support
3)  Directory structure rename
4)  Memo field processing fixes and enhancements
5)  Additional string class support
6)  Rename of major classes
