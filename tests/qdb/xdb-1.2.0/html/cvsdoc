These are the instructions for using CVS to access the current Xbase source 

1.   CVS Signons

  There are two types of signons for the xbase library.

  a)  Guest access - has read only access to the library
  b)  User access - has both read and write access to the library

  For guest access, the userid is cvsguest and the password is download.

  For user access, contact the server administrator at 
  <gkunkel@startech.keller.tx.us> for the username and password.


2. Login to CVS server:

  cvs -d :pserver:username@stargazer.startech.keller.tx.us:/usr/local/cvsroot login

  you will be asked:

  CVS password:

  Enter your password here.  If it is OK, you will see file .cvspass in
  your home directory.  You should keep it from anyone's eyes.  You can
  (must?) remove it later using 'cvs logout' or by hand.

3. Check out source tree (xbase):

  cvs -d :pserver:username@stargazer.startech.keller.tx.us:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout xbase

  From now on, you work the same as if repository is local.

4. Instead of specifying '-d :pserver:username@server.host/path/to/cvsroot'
   each time, you can set CVSROOT variable to that value:

For those of you who have never used a cvs server to access sources,
here's a short run down of how to do it:

1) Obtain sources from http://download.cyclic.com/pub/

2) Compile and install the client. 

   ./configure --disable-server   will disable the server

3) Once installed, set your CVSROOT environment to:

  :pserver:cvsguest@stargazer.startech.keller.tx.us:/usr/local/cvsroot

  For sh, bash and ksh users, execute the following commands:

    CVSROOT=:pserver:cvsguest@stargazer.startech.keller.tx.us:/usr/local/cvsroot
    export CVSROOT
  
    You may want to stick these commands in your .profile or .bash_profile.

  For C shell users (csh, tcsh), execute the following commands:

    setenv CVSROOT=:pserver:cvsguest@stargazer.startech.keller.tx.us:/usr/local/cvsroot
  
    You may want to stick this command in your .cshrc or .login file.

4) From here, login in to the server with 

     cvs login

5) Now get the source

     cvs checkout xbase
     
6) Now you can log out

     cvs logout
