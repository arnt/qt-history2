<h3>Overview</h3>

The main objective of this chapter is to provide information regarding the
basic concepts of using the Xbase Expression module.<br><br>

Beginning with release 1.7.4, the Xbase library includes an expression parsing
routine which assists application programmers by providing a high level data 
manipulation tool and also allows for building complex index keys.

The functions included are derived from dBASE III Plus, but not all 
dBASE III Plus functions have been implemented yet.

<br><br>

<h3>Internal fuctioning</h3>
The expression module works in two phases.  Firstly method <em>ParseExpression</em>
is called and builds an expression tree from all the components of the 
expression. The expression is checked for valid field names, literals, 
operands and functions.  Any field references are resolved.  If fields 
are used in an expression and the database name for the field is not 
included in the name with the -> operand, the routines assume the 
associated database has been successfully opened. 
<br><br>
Secondly, method <em>ProcessExpression</em> is called to process the expression
tree which was already created.  The routine parses each node in the expression
tree, executing functions, processing operands and manipulating data to 
produce the desired result.<br><br>

If an expression will be processed repeatedely, it is best to pre-parse the
tree using <em>ParseExpression</em>, then for each new call to the expression, 
execute method <em>ProcessExpression</em> which processes the tree. 


<h3>Expression Return Types</h3>
Expressions will return a type of CHAR *, NUMERIC or LOGICAL.<br><br> 

An expression return type can be determined with method <em>
GetExpressionResultType</em> after parsing it.<br><br>

Expressions returning a return type of CHAR are limited to a 200 internal 
buffer.  There is also a 100 byte limit for NDX index key support.  If 
the 200 byte limit is not large enough for your application, you can adjust the
the <em>enum { WorkBufMaxLen = 200 };</em> in file <em>exp.h</em>.

<h3>Expression Functions</h3>
Each expression function also has a corresponding C++ function.  It is
slightly more efficient to call the C++ functions directly, rather than 
execute the expression parsing routines. All functions which return CHAR * 
are returning a pointer to a static buffer which is overlaid by the next
call to any function which also returns CHAR *.

<h3>Expression Components</h3>
Expressions are made up of one or more tokens.  A token is one of literal, 
database field, operand or function.  Literals are either numeric or character.
Character literals are enclosed in 'single' or "double" quotes.  numeric 
literals are a series of one or more contiguous numerals, ".", "+" or "-'".
<br><br>
A field is simply a field name in the default database, or is in the form
of database->fieldname.
