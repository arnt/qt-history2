The main objective of this chapter is to provide information regarding the
basic concepts of utlilizing the HTML/CGI interface with Xbase.<br><br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The HTML/CGI interface is designed to work with web server technologies such
as the Apache Web Server.  The HTML class is a user interface
included with Xbase DBMS.<br><br>
Utilizing this technolgy leverages on the ability to generate code which is
useable on a wide variety of client platforms.  Any platform which runs a
browser program can access Xbase DBMS applications running on a web
server.<br><br>
Before using this class, it would be helpful to have an 
understanding of how HTML works, which is beyond the scope of this chapter.  
<br><br>
<h3>Internal Functioning</h3>
The HTML class is relatively simple.  When the class initializes, the 
class constructor creates an internal two dimensional array with field
names and data.  The array
is accessed by the GetData, GetArraryNo and GetDataForField methods.
<h3>Samples</h3>
There is one sample form <A HREF="/XbaseSamples/testhtml.html">testhtml.html</A>
and one sample program <A HREF="/XbaseSamples/testhtml.cpp">testhtml.cpp</A>
which demonstrate the use of the HTML class.<br><br>

<h3>Apache Install Hints</h3>
To run cgi scripts with apache,  the recommended approach is to compile
programs with a .cgi extension.  If the executable programs are not kept
int the cgi-bin directory,  then you will need to add a handler
to your Apache configuration script.
Addtionally,  in the Directory stanzas, add ExecCGI to the Options clause.

<br><br>
Examples:

<br><br>
Additional handler statement: <br>
<em>AddHandler cgi-script .cgi</em><br><br>
Directory Stanza:<br>

< Directory /usr/local/myproject > <br>
Options ExecCGI Indexes<br>
AllowOverride None<br>
Order allow,deny<br>
allow from all<br>
< /Directory ><br><br>
