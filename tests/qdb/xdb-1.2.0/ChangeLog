Fri Mar 19 15:25:43 1999  Vitaly V. Fedrushkov  <willy@apex.csu.ac.ru>

	* all includes moved to xbase/
	
	* xbase/xbase.cpp (xbXBase): free(NULL) prevented

	* xbase/xbexcept.cpp (xbStrError): unreachable return fixed

1999-02-27  Gary Kunkel  <gkunkel@startech.keller.tx.us>

        * created release 1.8.0b,  mainly 


1999-02-16  Vitaly V Fedrushkov  <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru>

	* bin/dbfutil1.cpp, bin/dumpdbt.cpp, examples/sample3.cpp,
	examples/sample2.cpp: depends on XB_MEMO_FIELDS

1999-02-15  Vitaly V Fedrushkov  <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru>

	* xbase/dbf.cpp (PackDatafiles): didn't compile without
	XB_MEMO_FIELDS

	* examples/testhtml.cpp: depends on XB_HTML

	* xbase/dbf.h: DumpHeader() depends on XBASE_DEBUG

	* bin/dbfutil1.cpp, bin/dumpdbt.cpp, bin/dumphdr.cpp,
	bin/checkndx.cpp: depends on XBASE_DEBUG

	* xbase/index.h, xbase/ndx.h, xbase/ntx.h: CheckIndexIntegrity
	depends on XBASE_DEBUG

	* configure.in: NTX support auto-configuration added
	fixed a bug which turned on castellano together with exceptions

	* xbase/lock.cpp, xbase/dbf.h: got rid of __XBDOS in favor of
	HAVE_FCNTL

	* acconfig.h: xbconfig.h.bot moved here
	(XB_INDEX_ANY): new define based on either XB_INDEX_NDX or
	XB_INDEX_NTX
	(XB_EXPRESSIONS): moved from xbase.h

	* xbase/lock.cpp, xbase/xbase.h, xbase/dbf.cpp, xbase/dbf.h:
	XB_INDEX_ANY used to include format-independent index processing
	code

	* xbase/index.h (class xbIndex): fixed 'const' mismatches at some
	declarations
	DumpXxx methods depend on XBASE_DEBUG

	* xbase/xbase.h: XB_EXPRESSIONS auto-inclusion logic moved to
	xbconfig.h

1999-02-14  Vitaly V Fedrushkov  <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru>

	* xbase/index.cpp: excess #includes removed

	* xbase/xbcf_b32.h: New.  Settings for Borland C++ 4.5.  Must be
	copied to xbconfig.h before compilation.

	* xbase/xdate.h, xbase/xbexcept.h, xbase/xbase.h, xbase/html.h,
	xbase/stack.cpp, xbase/dbf.h, xbase/exp.h: options.h changed to
	xbconfig.h

	* xbase/options.h: Rewritten.  Now contains only user-selectable
	options.  All the rest gets set in xbconfig.h.  From now on,
	options.h is consulted only via hand-made xbconfig.h.
	
	* xbase/xbstring.h: xbconfig.h included

	* xbase/ntx.cpp: added check for unistd.h.  Anyone know its
	purpose here?

	* xbase/lock.cpp: HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H typo
	(LockIndex): unrenamed symbol SEEK_ERROR?  Already had it fixed
	and committed, how did it survive...

	* xbase/html.cpp (Tally): Did not work without fcntl().
	Workaround effectively disables locking support even with
	XB_LOCKING_ON

	* xbase/memo.cpp (CreateMemoFile), xbase/fields.cpp (GetField):
	(const char*) to (char*) cast fix

	* xbase/lock.cpp (LockIndex) xbase/exp.cpp (LoadExpNode)
	xbase/fields.cpp (GetField) xbase/index.h (class xbIndex)
	xbase/xbase.cpp (PutShort, PutLong, PutUShort, PutULong,

	declarations


1999-02-13  Vitaly V Fedrushkov  <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru>

	* xbase/dbf.cpp (OpenDatabase): Hexcode used instead of 8-bit char
	for Version
	* xbase/dbf.h: Ditto

	* bin/dbfutil1.cpp (ConvertDatabase): Uninitialized pointer fixed

	* bin/dumpdbt.cpp (main): '#endif XB_LOCKING_ON' fixed

	DESCEND() useless.

1999-02-11  Vitaly V Fedrushkov  <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru>

	* xbase/Makefile.am (libxbase_la_LDFLAGS): CURRENT version number
	incremented to reflect interface changes

	* tv/Makefile.am (tvxbase_SOURCES): header file was missing from
	distribution

	* Makefile.cvs (all): Fixed a bug that made 'configure' missing
	from 'make dist' tarball.

	* Makefile.am, */Makefile.am (MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): All
	auto-generated files are subject to 'make maintainer-clean', which
	should now reduce all directories to their CVS contents.

1999-02-11  Vitaly V Fedrushkov  <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): COPYING.LIB instead of COPYING.GPL

	  "\x0D\x1A". 
		- Added SetEofChar()
	- Added Clipper .NTX support.
		- Abstracted all referneces from ndx to index.
	- Added support for Clipper and FoxPro character fields longer
	  then 255 characters. Determined by a char field and a
	  decimal field > 0.
		- Added LongFieldLen to Schema to represent this.
	- Fix for incrementing CurRec on an AppendRecord().
	- Fix in dump record to handle large fields

exp.cpp and expfunc.cpp
	- Added DESCEND(). Only works for dates.
	- Added DTOS(). Date to string.
	- Added RECNO() returns the current record number.
	- Added 2 and 3 parameter versions of STR()
	- Added STRZERO()
	- Small expression parsing fix

expproc.cpp
	- Added support for quoted strings in expressions.


ndx.cpp
	- Changed NodeLink to NdxNodeLink
	- Moved common instance variables to index.cpp

xbase.cpp
	- Added GetULong(), PutUShort(), PutULong(). Not sure if
	  they're necessary.

New Files
	index.cpp  Index Base class for ndx and ntx classes
	index.h 
	ntx.cpp    Clipper NTX class.
	ntx.h

To Do:
	- Some methods are almost identical in ntx.cpp and
	  ndx.cpp. These could be moved to index.cpp.
1999-02-05  Vitaly V Fedrushkov  <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru>

	* xbase/lock.cpp (LockIndex): unrenamed symbol

	Some HAVE_EXCEPTIONS cleanup:

	(AddDbfToDbfList): xb_memory_error applied
	* xbase/xbexcept.h: xbStrError() prototype
	* xbase/xbexcept.cpp (xbStrError): moved outside HAVE_EXCEPTIONS.
	It is useful anyway.

	* xbase/xstack.h (xbStack::xbStack): Redundant scope qualifier removed
	* xbase/exp.h(class xbExpn): Token( void ) removed.  Not seen
