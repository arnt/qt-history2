This is a custom AppWizard for Visual C++.

It only implements basic functionality at the moment, but it is
committed to the repository, so that it can be compared with other
existing solutions, and eventually included in the MSVC integration
package for Qt-Main.

Have fun with it, feel free to modify the code.

By default, the project is configured to copy the AppWizard file to
the MSVC AppWizard directory.
