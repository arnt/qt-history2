Style

* Easier Usage
  + Auto overide style if specified in skin.
  + Auto set skin and find skin file. 
    (e.g. -skin name, inbuilt to qapplication).
* Custom widgets
* Better example.  Something at least partially functional.
* Layout
  + Should be able to have resizable layouts.  This one will require some
    creativity though.
* Undo
  + Should be able to change skins
  + Should be able to go to normal style
