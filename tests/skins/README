If you do any work on this stuff, add it into here please.

Attribute for scaling won't be added for a while.  It is going to be slow by
neccesity.  For widgets that need to stretch, (spacers, tab bars) will use 
tiling instead.

QWidgets
* QPushButton		90%		partial
  - Still needs label/no-label option.

  Attributes include 'label/nolabel'

* QDial			90%		partial
  - Still needs start/end angle, As well as 2 image mode.  E.G. Base, 
    peg, hotspot (on peg).
  - Still needs to be done in styles.  Currently external class.

  Attributes include 'startangle' 'endangle'
  
* QCheckBox		50%
  - Still needs label image, along with label/no-label options.

  Attributes inclde 'label/nolabel'

* QRadioButton		50%
  - Same as QCheckBox

* Digital disp		0
  - Not much to do here... except force dropping of frame box

* QSlider		30%
  - Still need angle (up/down/left/right).  Also the multi-image mode is still
    needed.

  Attributes include 'direction'

!!! NO MORE NEW SKINNED WIDGETS TILL THE ABOVE ARE DONE CORRECTLY.
 
* QComboBox		0
* QScrollBar		0
* QTabWidget		0
* QToolButton		0

Style

* Easier Usage
  + Auto overide style if specified in skin.
  + Auto set skin and find skin file. 
    (e.g. -skin name, inbuilt to qapplication).
* Custom widgets
* Better example.  Something at least partially functional.
* Layout
  + Should be able to have resizable layouts.  This one will require some
    creativity though.
* Undo
  + Should be able to change skins
  + Should be able to go to normal style

Anything that can be done to an application (palette etc) should be able to be 
done to a widget.  Hence there should be no distinction except for whether or 
not it is encaspulated within a <widget></widget>.
