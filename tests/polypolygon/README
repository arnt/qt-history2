support/arc-16/33101 suggested to have a painter function that allows to
draw a polygon with holes (he calls it polypolygon -- I don't know if this
is a good name). It really seems that something like this is not possible
with the actual API. He sent some code that does the job for him. This is
the stuff he sent together with a small example program.

This is the functionality (at least more or less) that the Windows GDI
function PolyPolygon supplies.

Evaluate if this is something we want in QPainter and what API we want for
it.
