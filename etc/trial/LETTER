Dear CUSTOMER,

Thank you for your interest in Qt.

You may download the trial version of Qt for Windows from a hidden
directory on our ftp server.  The package consists of two files:

	ftp://ftp.troll.no/.private/SECRET/qtwin131trial.zip
	ftp://ftp.troll.no/.private/SECRET/qt_msvc5.zip

qtwin131.zip contains Qt header files, example programs, a tutorial and a
comprehensive on-line documentation.  The other file contains a
time-limited trial version of the Qt library for your compiler.

The real distribution includes the full source code and supports Microsoft
Visual C++ 4.x and 5.0, Borland C++, Symantec C++, Watcom C++ and
Cygnus Win32 gcc.

Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about Qt.

Kind regards,

-haavard
