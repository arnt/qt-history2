INITIAL STEPS TO BUILD THE TRIAL
--------------------------------

We unpack Qt 1.31 and patch with the trial source patches.

Compile Qt, create these libraries:
  - MSVC++ 5.0
  - MSVC++ 4.2
  - Borland C++ 5.0
  - Cygwin 32 gcc

Create examples/tutorial makefiles for Borland and Cygnus using TMAKE.

The trial should consist of two packages:
  qtwin131trial.zip - contains Qt without source code, library or makefiles.
		    - This can be stored on ftp.troll.no
and one of these:
  qtlib_msvc5.zip   - library and makefiles for MS Visual C++ 5
  qtlib_msvc4.zip   - library and makefiles for MS Visual C++ 4
  qtlib_borland.zip - library and makefiles for Borland C++ 5
  qtlib_gcc.zip	    - library and makefiles for Cygnus Win32 gcc

Directory structure:
  trial/msvc5/qt/lib
  trial/msvc5/qt/examples/
  trial/msvc5/qt/examples/*
  trial/msvc5/qt/tutorial/
  trial/msvc5/qt/tutorial/*
  trial/msvc4/qt/lib
    ... and so on.


FOR EACH TRIAL
--------------

When a customer wants a trial, we need this info:
  Name
  Company (optional)
  Email
  Compiler
  Expiry

We run a perl scripts which starts a GUI program to create feed it with
paramters.  Starts with a dialog which takes the four important
parameters.  The date field is filled in by default.

"Cancel" is clicked.  The program terminates.

"OK" is clicked (default?).

SQL: begin tran
The program first checks if the user has already been registered as
a trial user.  If so, it prints the old record(s).
Then it checks if the company has ran a trial before in the same way.
A listbox shows these results.
The user can "OK" or "Cancel" the operation.
Then the data is inserted and the highest identifier is returned.
SQL: commit tran

Then, the program prints the results:
name *
company *
email *
compiler *
expiry * 

The initial perl scripts now calls qtrial to build the actual trial, zips
the files and uses scp to transfer the file to zen.  It then uses ssh +
md5sum to check that the file has been successfully transferred.
Copies it to ftp/.private/<key>/qtlib_msvc5.zip.
Tries up to 5 times in case of errors.
Makes a hard link from trial/qtwin131trial.zip to ftp/.private/<key>

Finally, produce a nice letter which is printed on stdout. If $EDITOR
is defined, use the editor.
