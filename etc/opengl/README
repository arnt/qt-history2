		     OpenGL for Qt - The QGL classes

QGLWidget (qglwidget.h) is a Qt wrapper class for OpenGL and Mesa. To use
OpenGL in your Qt application, create a subclass of QGLWidget and
implement two or more virtual functions. The HTML file qgl.html
contains documentation for the GLWidget.

The documentation is incomplete and I don't have enough sample programs.
The gears.cpp file is a reworked example from the Mesa 2.0 distribution.
The GearWidget is a simple OpenGL widget.

If you have a small and intuitive example program that you want to give to
us, I can include it in the distribution.
