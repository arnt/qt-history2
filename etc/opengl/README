This example program demonstrates how to use Qt with OpenGL or Mesa.

We've implemented a widget called GLWidget (in glwidget.h) , which is a
general wrapper for OpenGL. You can subclass this widget to create your
own OpenGL widget. Study the Nurb widget (in nurb.h) to see how.

The NurbSample widget in main.cpp contains a Nurb widget and some buttons
to manipulate the Nurb's parameters.

This is free code and Troll Tech has no responsibilities for it.
