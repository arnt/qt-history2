                GLWidget - A Qt wrapper widget for OpenGL

GLWidget (glwidget.h) is a Qt wrapper class for OpenGL and Mesa. To use
OpenGL in your Qt application, create a subclass of GLWidget and implement
some virtual functions. The HTML file glwidget.html contains documentation
for the GLWidget.

Study the Nurb (nurb.h) example to see how you can make your own OpenGL
widgets. The NurbSample widget in main.cpp contains a Nurb widget and some
buttons to manipulate the Nurb's parameters.
