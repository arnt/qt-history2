<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

Qt provides excellent support for translating applications into local
languages. This Guide explains how to use Qt's translation tools for
each of the roles involved in translating an application. The Guide
begins with a brief overview of the issues that must be considered,
followed by chapters devoted to each role and the supporting tools
provided. 

<em>Chapter 1: Release Manager</em> is aimed at the person with overall
responsibility for the release of the application. They will typically
coordinate the work of the software engineers and the translator. The
chapter describes the use of two tools. The <a href="#lupdate">lupdate</a> 
tool is used to synchronise source code and translations. The 
<a href="#lrelease">lrelease</a> tool is used to create runtime
translation files for use by the released application.

<em>Chapter 2: Translators</em> is for translators. It describes the use
of the <em>Qt Linguist</em> tool. No computer knowledge beyond the
ability to start a program and use a text editor or word-processor is
required.

<em>Chapter 3: Programmers</em> is for Qt programmers. It
explains how to create Qt applications that are able to use translated
text. It also provides guidance on how to help the translator identify
the context in which phrases appear. This chapter's three short
tutorials cover everything the programmer needs to do.

<h2><a name="Brief_Overview_of_the_Translation_Process">
Brief Overview of the Translation Process</a></h2>

Most of the text that must be translated in an application program
consists of either single words or short phrases. These typically appear
as window titles, menu items, pop-up help text (balloon help), and
labels to buttons, check boxes and radio buttons. 

The phrases are entered into the source code by the programmer in their
native language using a simple but special syntax to identify that the
phrases require translation. The Qt tools provide context information
for each of the phrases to help the translator, and the programmer is
able to add additional context information to phrases when necessary.
The release manager generates a set of translation files that are
produced from the source files and passes these to the translator. The
translator opens the translation files using <em>Qt Linguist</em>,
enters their translations and saves the results back into the
translation files which they pass back to the release manager. The
release manager then generates fast compact versions of these
translation files ready for use by the application. The tools are
designed to be used in repeated cycles as applications change and
evolve, preserving existing translations and making it easy to identify
which new translations are required. <em>Qt Linguist</em> also provides
a phrase book facility to help ensure consistent translations across
multiple applications and projects.

Translators and programmers must address a number of issues because of
the subtleties and complexities of human language:

<ul>
<li> A single phrase may need to be translated into several different
forms depending on context, e.g. \e open in English might become
\e &ouml;ffnen, "open file", or \e aufbauen, "open internet connection",
in German. 
<li> Keyboard accelerators may need to be changed but without
introducing conflicts, e.g. "&Quit" in English becomes "Avslutt" in
Norwegian which doesn't contain a "Q". We cannot use a letter that is
already in use -- unless we change several accelerators. 
<li> Phrases that contain variables, e.g. "The 25 files selected will
take 63 seconds to process", where the two numbers are inserted
programmatically at runtime may need to be reworked because in a
different language the word order and therefore the placement of the
variables may have to change.
</ul>

The Qt translation tools provide clear and simple solutions to these
issues.

<h1><a name="Chapter_1:_Release_Manager">Chapter 1: Release Manager</a></h1>

Two tools are provided for the release manager, \e lupdate and \e lrelease.

<h2><a name="lupdate">lupdate</a></h2>

Usage: <code>lupdate myproject.pro</code>

This is a simple command line tool. \e lupdate reads a Qt \c .pro
project file and produces or updates the \c .ts translation source files
listed in the project file. The translation files are given to the
translator who uses <em>Qt Linguist</em> to read the files and insert
the translations. 

Companies that have their own translators in-house may find it useful
to run \e lupdate regularly, perhaps monthly, as the application
develops. This will lead to a fairly low volume of translation work
spread evenly over the life of the project and will allow the
translators to support a number of projects simultaneously. 

Companies that hire in translators as required may prefer to run \e
lupdate only a few times in the application's life-cycle, the first time
might be just before the first test phase. This will provide the
translator with a substantial single block of work and any bugs that the
translator detects may easily be included with those found during the
initial test phase. The second and any subsequent \e lupdate runs would
probably take place during the final beta phase.

The \c .ts file format is a simple human-readable XML format that can
be used with version control systems if required.

<h2><a name="lrelease">lrelease</a></h2>

Usage: <code>lrelease myproject.pro</code>

This is another simple command line tool. It reads a Qt \c .pro project
file and produces the \c .qm files used by the application, one for each
\c .ts translation source file listed in the project file. The \c .qm
file format is a compact binary format that provides extremely fast
lookups for translations.

This tool is run whenever a release of the application is to be made,
from initial test version through to final release version. If the \c
.qm files are not created, e.g. because an alpha release is required
before any translation has been undertaken, the application will run
perfectly well using the text the programmers placed in the source
files. Once the \c .qm files are available the application will detect
them and use them automatically.

Note that \e lrelease will only incorporate translations that are marked
as "done". If a translation is missing, or has failed validation, or is
not marked as done, the original text will be used instead.

<h2><a name="Qt_Project_Files">Qt Project Files</a></h2>

\e lupdate and \e lrelease depend on information in the application's \c
.pro Qt project file. For each language additional to the native
language there must be an entry in the \c TRANSLATIONS section of the
project file. A typical entry looks like this:

\dontinclude tt2/tt2.pro
\skip TRANSLATIONS
\line TRANSLATIONS
\until ^$

Using a locale within the filename is useful for determining which
language to load at runtime -- this is explained in 
<a href="#Chapter_3:_Programmers">Chapter 3: Programmers</a>.

<h2><a name="Incomplete_Translations">Incomplete Translations</a></h2>

Both \e lupdate and \e lrelease may be used with \c .ts translation
source files which are incomplete. Missing translations will be replaced
with the native language phrases at runtime.

<h2><a name="The_1_Minute_Guide_to_Using_Qt_Linguist">
The One Minute Guide to Using Qt Linguist</a></h2>

<em>Qt Linguist</em> is a tool for adding translations to Qt
applications. It introduces the concept of a translation "context" which
means a group of phrases that appear together on the screen e.g. in the
same menu or dialog.

To start, run <em>Qt Linguist</em>, either from the taskbar menu, or by
double clicking the desktop icon, or type <code>linguist[ENTER]</code>
at the command line. Once <em>Qt Linguist</em> has started choose
<em>File|Open</em> from the menu bar and select a \c .ts translation
source file to work on.

Click on one of the contexts in the source text area (the left hand
pane) and then click on one of the phrases that appears. The phrase will
be copied into the top right pane with two lines beneath it separating
the context and comments from the phrase. Click in the translation area
(the middle right pane) and type in the translation. Click the <em>Done &
Next</em> button (or press Alt+D) to mark the translation as complete and
move on to the next phrase. Enter the next translation and then press
Alt+D repeating as often as necessary. At the end of the session choose
<em>File|Save</em> from the menu bar and then <em>File|Exit</em> to quit.

Whilst the above is sufficient most of the time, some tasks require the
use of other buttons or controls. The \e Skip button is covered in the 
<a href="Leaving_a_Translation_for_Later">"Leaving a Translation for
Later"</a> section. The <em>Start from Source</em> and the <em>Guess
Again</em> buttons are described in the 
<a href="Reusing_Translations">"Reusing Translations"</a> section. The
phrase book pane is explained in the 
<a href="#Creating_and_Using_Phrase_Books"> "Creating and Using Phrase
Books"</a> section.


<h2><a name="Common_Tasks">Common Tasks</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Leaving_a_Translation_for_Later">
Leaving a Translation for Later</a></h3>

If you wish to leave a translation simply click the \e Skip button (or
press Alt+K) to move on to the next phrase. To move to a different
context and phrase altogether click in the left hand source text pane on
the context you wish to work on and then click on a phrase. Phrases
that are done have an "X" marked in the Done column of the source text
pane. If all the phrases in a context are done the context itself will
have an "X" marked in the Done column.

<h3><a name="Phrases_That_Require_Multiple_Translations_Depending_on_Context">
Phrases That Require Multiple Translations Depending on Context</a></h3>

The same phrase may occur in two or more contexts without conflict. Once
a phrase has been translated in one context, <em>Qt Linguist</em> notes
that the translation has been made and when the translator reaches a
later occurrence of the same phrase <em>Qt Linguist</em> will provide
the previous translation as a possible translation candidate. If the
previous translation is acceptable just click the <em>Done & Next</em>
button (press Alt+D) to move on to the next phrase.

If a phrase occurs more than once in a particular context it will only
be shown once in <em>Qt Linguist's</em> left hand source text pane and
the translation will be applied to every occurrence within the context.
If the same phrase needs to be translated differently within the same
context the programmer must provide a distinguishing comment for each of
the phrases concerned. If such comments are used the duplicate phrases
will appear in the left hand source text pane whilst the phrase, the
programmer's comment and the context are shown in the top right pane so
that the translator can distinguish between the identical source texts.

<h3><a name="Changing_Keyboard_Accelerators">
Changing Keyboard Accelerators</a></h3>

A keyboard accelerator is a key combination that when pressed will
cause an application to perform an action. Keyboard accelerators
normally come in two forms: Alt key and Ctrl key accelerators. 

Alt key accelerators are used for menus and buttons.  The underlining
signifies that pressing the Alt key with the underlined letter is the
same as clicking the menu item with the mouse.  For example, most
applications have a \e File menu with the "F" in the word "file"
underlined. In these applications the file menu can be invoked either by
clicking the word "File" on the menu bar or by pressing Alt+F. The
accelerator key which is underlined is signified by preceeding it with
an ampersand, e.g. \e &File. If a source phrase appears with an
ampersand in it then the translation should also contain an ampersand,
preferably in front of the same letter. The meaning of Alt key
accelerators can be determined from the phrase in which the ampersand is
embedded. The translator may need to change the letter used with the Alt
key, e.g. if the translated phrase does not contain the original
accelerator letter. Conflicts with other keys, i.e. having two Alt key
accelerators using the same letter in the same context, must be avoided.
Note that some Alt key accelerators, usually those on the menu bar, may
apply in other contexts. 

Ctrl key accelerators can exist independently of any visual
control. They are often used to invoke actions in menus that would
otherwise take several keystrokes or mouse clicks. They may also be used
to perform actions that do not appear in any menu or on any button. For
example, most applications that have a \e File menu have a submenu item
called \e New. In many applications this will appear as
<em><u>N</u>ew... Ctrl+N</em>. This menu option could be invoked by
clicking \e File then clicking \e New with the mouse. Or you could press
Alt+F then press N since these letters are underlined. But the same
thing can be achieved simply by pressing Ctrl+N. Accelerators that use
the Ctrl key are shown literally in the source text, e.g.
<em>Ctrl+N</em>. Ctrl key accelerators have no phrase so the translator
must rely on the programmer to add a "comment" which appears in the
top right hand pane. This comment should explain what action the Ctrl
key accelerator performs. Ideally Ctrl key accelerators are translated
simply by copying them by clicking the <em>Start from Source</em> button.
However in some cases the letter will not make sense in the target
language and must be changed. Whatever letter (or digit) is chosen, the
translation should always be in the form "Ctrl+" followed by the letter
or digit in upper case. As with Alt key accelerators, if the translator
changes the key it must not conflict with any other Ctrl key
accelerator.

Later versions of <em>Qt Linguist</em> are expected to help the
translator avoid accelerator conflicts.

<h3><a name="Dealing_with_Phrases_That_Contain_Variables">
Dealing with Phrases That Contain Variables</a></h3>

Some phrases contain variables. Variables are placeholders for items of
text that are filled in at runtime. They are signified in the source
text with a percent sign followed by a digit, e.g. <em>After processing
file %1, file %2 is next in line.</em> In this example, \c %1 will be
replaced at runtime with the name of the first file to be processed and
\c %2 with the name of the next file to be processed. In the translated
version the variables must still appear. For example a German
translation might reverse the phrases, e.g. <em>Datei %2 wird
bearbeitet, wenn. Datei %1 fertig ist.</em> Note that both variables
are still used but their order has changed. The order in which variables
appear does not matter; \c %1 will always be replaced by the same text
at runtime no matter where it appears in the source text or translation
and similarly \c %2, etc. 

<h3><a name="Reusing_Translations">Reusing Translations</a></h3>

If the translated text is similar to the source text, click the
<em>Start from Source</em> button (press Alt+S) which will copy the
source text into the translation pane. 

If you have translated a phrase that is the same or similar to one you
are about to translate, click the <em>Guess Again</em> button (press
Alt+G) to force <em>Qt Linguist</em> to try to find a close match to use
as the initial translation.

If the source phrase matches a source phrase in the current phrase book,
<em>Qt Linguist</em> will display the phrase and its translation in the
phrase book pane at the bottom right of the main window. Double clicking
the target phrase will copy it to the translation pane. 

<h2><a name="Creating_and_Using_Phrase_Books">
Creating and Using Phrase Books</a></h2>

<center><img src="images/phrasebookdialog.png" alt="Phrase Book Dialog">
<h5>Phrase Book Dialog</h5></center>

A <em>Qt Linguist</em> phrase book is a set of source phrases, target
(translated) phrases, and optional definitions. Phrase Books are created
independently of any application, although typically one phrase book
will be created per application or family of applications. 

If the translator reaches an untranslated phrase that is the same as a
source phrase in the phrase book, <em>Qt Linguist</em> will show the
phrase book entry in the <em>Relevant phrases</em> panel at the bottom
right of the main window. Phrases which have translations that conflict
with those given in the phrase book are marked "(?)" in the source text
pane. Phrase Books are used to provide a common set of translations to
help ensure consistency. They can also be used to avoid duplication of
effort since the translations for a family of applications can be
produced once in the phrase book and the phrase book used for the
majority of translations in each application.

Before a phrase book can be edited it must be created or if it already
exists, opened. Create a new phrase book by selecting
<em>Phrase|New Phrase Book</em> from the menu bar. You must enter a
filename and may change the location of the file if you wish. A newly
created phrase book is automatically opened. Open an existing phrase
book by choosing <em>Phrase|Open Phrase Book</em> from the menu bar. 

To add a new phrase click the <em>New Phrase</em> button (or press
Alt+N) and type in a new source phrase. Press Tab and type in the
translation. Optionally press Tab and enter a definition -- this is
useful to distinguish different translations of the same source phrase.
This process may be repeated as often as necessary. 

You can delete a phrase by selecting it in the phrases list and clicking
Remove Phrase.

Click the \e Save button (press Alt+S) and then click the \e Close
button (press Esc) once you've finished adding (and removing) phrases.

When a phrase or set of phrases appears in the phrase book double
clicking the required target phrase will copy it to the translation pane
at the text cursor position. If you want to \e replace the text in the
translation pane with the target phrase, click the translation pane,
choose <em>Edit|Select All</em> (press Alt+A) and then double click the
target phrase.

<h2><a name="Validation">Validation</a></h2>

<em>Qt Linguist</em> provides three kinds of validation on translated
phrases. 

<ol>
<li><em>Accelerator validation</em> detects translated phrases
that do not have an ampersand when the source phrase does and vice
versa.
<li><em>Punctuation validation</em> detects differences in the
terminating punctuation between source and translated phrases when this
may be significant, e.g. warns if the source phrase ends with an
ellipsis, exclamation mark or question mark, and the translated phrase
doesn't and vice versa.
<li><em>Phrases validation</em> detects source phrases that are
also in the phrase book but whose translation differs from that given in
the phrase book.
</ol>

Validation may be switched on or off from the menu bar's Validation item
or using the toolbar buttons. Phrases that fail validation are marked
with "(?)" in the source text pane. If you switch validation off and
then switch it on later <em>Qt Linguist</em> will recheck all phrases
and mark any that fail validation.

If any phrase in a context is invalid the context itself will be marked
with "(?)"; if all the phrases in a context are done and valid the
context will be marked with "X", otherwise the context is left unmarked.

Note that only phrases which are marked as done, "X", will be appear in
the application. Invalid phrases and phrases which are translated but
not marked as done are kept in the translation source file but are not
used by the application.

<h2><a name="Qt_Linguist_Reference">Qt Linguist Reference</a></h2>

<h3><a name="File_Types">File Types</a></h3>

<em>Qt Linguist</em> makes use of three kinds of file:

<ul>
<li>\c .ts <em>translation source files</em><br>are human-readable XML
files containing source phrases and their translations. These files are
usually created and updated by \e lupdate and are specific to an
application.
<li>\c .qm <em>Qt message files</em><br>are binary files that contain
translations used by an application at runtime. These files are
generated by \e lrelease, but can also be generated by <em>Qt
Linguist</em>.
<li>\c .qph <em>Qt phrase book files</em><br>are human-readable XML
files containing standard phrases and their translations. These files
are created and updated by <em>Qt Linguist</em> and may be used by any
number of projects and applications.
</ul>

<h3><a name="The_Main_Window">The Main Window</a></h3>

The main window is divided into four main areas. 

<ul>
<li>The left of the window contains the 
<a href="#The_Source_Text_Pane">Source Text Pane</a> that lists all the
phrases in the \c .ts translations source file in a tree view grouped by
contexts.
<li>The top right area is the
<a href="#The_Source_Text_Comments_Pane">Source Text and Comments
Pane</a> for the current phrase.
<li>The middle right area is the 
<a href="#The_Translation_Pane">Translation Pane</a>.
<li>The bottom right area contains the
<a href="#The_Phrasebook_Pane">Phrase Book Pane</a>
and the <a href="#The_Command_Buttons">Command Buttons</a>.
</ul>

These areas are described after the menu bar and toolbar descriptions.

<h3><a name="The_Source_Text_Pane">The Source Text Pane</a></h3>

<center><img src="images/sourcetext.png" alt="The Source Text Pane">
<h5>The Source Text Pane</h5></center>

This pane is on the left hand side of the main window. It shows a tree
view of all the contexts and within each context its phrases. A second
column called "Done" is used to mark the phrases and contexts. 

An "X" next to a source phrase signifies that it has been translated and
marked as "done". An "(?)" signifies a translation which has a
validation conflict. An "(obs.)" signifies an obsolete translation, i.e.
a translation used in a previous version of the application but which is
not in the current version. 

An "X" next to a context signifies that all the phrases in that context
have been translated. A "(?)" next to a context signifies that one or
more phrases in the context have a translation validation conflict. 

The "X" mark is important since only source phrases that are marked with
it have their translations used in the application. This mark can be
added or removed from a source phrase by clicking in the "Done" column
of the source text pane to the right of the source text or by clicking
the "Done" checkbox above the command buttons. (The checkbox only
affects the source text highlighted in the source text pane.)  The "X"
mark can only be added to source texts which have a translation that
passes validation. 

The contexts are ordered alphabetically. The phrases within each context
are in the order in which they appear in the source program and this may
not be the order in which they are shown on screen.

The Source Text and Comments Pane</a></h3>

<center><img src="images/sourcetextandcomments.png" alt="The Source Text and

The source text and comments pane is at the top right of the main
window. It is divided into three sections. The top section shows the
source phrase. The middle section, between the two lines, shows the
programmer's comment if there is one -- this is used to disambiguate
between otherwise identical source texts. The bottom section, below
the two lines, shows the context -- this is normally a single word (the
class-name in programmer's parlance) and a comment that should contain
information about the context, e.g. how to navigate to where the text
appears in the application so that the translator can see what it looks
like.

<h3><a name="The_Phrase_Dialog">The Phrase Dialog</a></h3>

This dialog is explained in the 
<a href="#Creating_and_Using_Phrase_Books">
"Creating and Using Phrase Books"</a> section.

<h1><a name="Chapter_3:_Programmers">Chapter 3: Programmers</a></h1>

Support for multiple languages is extremely simple in Qt applications
and adds little overhead to the programmer's workload. 

Qt minimises the performance cost of using translations by translating
the phrases for each window as they are created. In most applications
the main window is created just once. Dialogs are often created once and
then shown and hidden as required. Once the initial translation has
taken place there is no further runtime overhead for the translated
windows. Only those windows that are created, destroyed and subsequently
created will have a translation performance cost -- although the
overhead is still very low.

Creating applications that can switch language at runtime is possible
with Qt, but requires a certain amount of programmer intervention and
will of course incur some runtime performance cost.

<h2><a name="Making_The_Application_Translation_Aware">
Making The Application Translation Aware</a></h2>

Programmers make their application look for and load the appropriate
translation file and mark user-visible text and Ctrl keyboard
accelerators as targets for translation. 

Each piece of text that requires translating requires context to help
the translator identify where in the program the text occurs. In the
case of multiple identical texts that require different translations
the translator also requires some information to disambiguate the source
texts. Marking text for translation will automatically cause the class
name to be used as basic context information. In some cases the
programmer may be required to add additional information to help the
translator.

<h3><a name="#Creating_Translation_Files">Creating Translation Files</a></h3>

Translation files consist of all the user-visible text and Ctrl key
accelerators in an application and translations of that text.
Translation files are created as follows: 

<ol>
<li><a href="#lupdate">lupdate</a> is run initially to generate the
first set of \c .ts translation source files with all the user-visible
text but no translations.
<li>The \c .ts files are given to the translator who adds translations
using <em>Qt Linguist</em>. <em>Qt Linguist</em> takes care of changed
or deleted source text.
<li>\e lupdate is run to incorporate any new text added to the
application. \e lupdate synchronises the user-visible text from the
application with the translations; it does not destroy any data.
<li>Steps 2 and 3 are repeated as often as necessary. 
<li>When a release of the application is needed <a
href="#lrelease">lrelease</a> is run to read the \c .ts files and
produce the \c .qm files used by the application at runtime.
</ol>

For \e lupdate to work successfully, it must know which translation
files to produce. The files are simply listed in the application's \c
.pro Qt project file, for example:
\dontinclude tt2/tt2.pro
\skip TRANSLATIONS
\line TRANSLATIONS
\until ^$

See the <a href="#lupdate">"lupdate"</a> and
<a href="#lrelease">"lrelease"</a> sections.

<h3><a name="Loading_Translations">Loading Translations</a></h3>

\dontinclude tt1/main.cpp
\skip main(
\line main(
\until QApplication

This is how the \c main() function of a canonical Qt application begins.

\dontinclude tt1/main.cpp
\skip main(
\line main(
\until app.installTrans

For a translation-aware application a translator object is created, a
translation loaded and the translator object installed into the
application.

\dontinclude tt2/main.cpp
\skip main(
\line main(
\until app.installTrans

In production applications a more flexible approach, for example,
loading translations according to locale, might be more appropriate. If
the \c .ts files are all named according to a convention such as
<em>appname_locale</em>, e.g. \c tt2_fr, \c tt2_de etc, then the
code above will load the current locale's translation at runtime.

If there is no translation file for the current locale the application
will fall back to using the original source text.

<h3><a name="Making_User-Visible_Strings_Translate">
Making the Application Translate User-Visible Strings</a></h3>

User-visible strings are marked as translation targets by wrapping them
in a \c tr() call, e.g. 

\code
    button = new QPushButton( "&Quit", this );
\endcode

would become 

\code
    button = new QPushButton( tr( "&Quit" ), this);
\endcode

All QObject subclasses that use the Q_OBJECT macro have a
reimplementation of the \c tr() function.

Although the \c tr() call is normally made directly since it is usually
called as a member function of a QObject subclass, in other cases an
explicit class name can be supplied, e.g. 

\code
    QPushButton::tr( "&Quit" )
\endcode 

or

\code
    QObject::tr( "&Quit" )
\endcode

<h3><a name="Distinguishing_Identical_Strings_That_Require_Different_Translations">
Distinguishing Identical Strings That Require Different Translations</a></h3>

The \e lupdate program automatically provides a \e context for every
source text. This context is the class name of the class that contains
the \c tr() call. This is sufficient in the vast majority of cases.
Sometimes however, the translator will need further information to
uniquely identify a source text; for example, a dialog that contained
two separate frames, each of which contained an "Enabled" option would
need each identified because in some languages the translation would
differ between the two. This is easily achieved using the
two argument form of the \c tr() call, e.g. 

\code
    rbc = new QRadioButton( tr( "Enabled", "Color frame" ), this);
\endcode 

and 

\code
    rbh = new QRadioButton( tr( "Enabled", "Hue frame" ), this);
\endcode

Ctrl key accelerators are also translatable:

\dontinclude tt3/mainwindow.cpp
\skip quit()
\line quit()
\until Quit

It is strongly recommended that the two argument form of \c tr() is used
for Ctrl key accelerators. The second argument is the only clue the
translator has as to the function performed by the accelerator.

<h3><a name="Helping_The_Translator_With_Navigation_Information">
Helping The Translator With Navigation Information</a></h3>

In large complex applications it may be difficult for the translator to
see where a particular source text comes from. This problem can be
solved by adding a comment using the keyword \e TRANSLATOR which
describes the navigation steps to reach the text in question; e.g.

<pre>
/*  TRANSLATOR FindDialog
 
    Choose Edit|Find from the menu bar or press Alt+F to pop up the
    Find dialog.
*&#47;
</pre>

These comments are particularly useful just before user-visible classes
such as dialog classes.

<h2><a name="Tutorials">Tutorials</a></h2>

Three tutorials are presented. The first demonstrates the creation of a
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qtranslator.html">QTranslator</a>
object. It also shows the simplest use of the \c tr() function to mark
user-visible source text for translation. The second tutorial explains
how to make the application load the translation file applicable to the
current locale. It also shows the use of the two-argument form of \c
tr() which provides additional information to the translator. The third
tutorial explains how identical source texts can be distinguished even
when they occur in the same context. This tutorial also discusses how
the translation tools help minimise the translator's work when an
application is upgraded.

<h4>Line by Line Walk-Through</h4>

\dontinclude tt1/main.cpp

\skip qtranslator
\line qtranslator

This line includes the definition of the
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qtranslator.html">QTranslator</a>
class.  Objects of this class provide translations for user-visible
text.

\skip QTranslator
\until tor

Create a QTranslator object without a parent.

\line load

Try to load a file called \c tt1_la.qm (the \c .qm file extension is
implicit) that contains Latin translations for the source texts used in
the program. No error will occur if the file is not found.

\line installTranslator

Add the translations from \c tt1_la.qm to the pool of translations used
by the program. No error will occur if the file was not found.

\line hello

Creates a push button that displays "Hello world!".  If \c tt1_la.qm was
found and contains a translation for "Hello world!", the translation
appears; if not, the source text appears.

All classes that inherit
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qobject.html">QObject</a> have a \c
tr() function.  Inside a member function of a QObject class, we simply
write <code>tr("Hello world!")</code> instead of
<code>QPushButton::tr("Hello world!")</code> or <code>QObject::tr("Hello
world!")</code>.

<h4>Running the Application in English</h4>

Since we haven't made the translation file \c tt1_la.qm, the source text
is shown when we run the application:

<center><img src="images/tt1_en.png"
alt="Screenshot of the English version of tutorial 1">
<h5>Tutorial 1 Screenshot, English version</h5></center>

<h4>Creating a Latin Message File</h4>

The first step is to create a project file,
\link tt1-tt1-pro.html tt1.pro\endlink, that lists all the source files
for the project.  The project file can be a
<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/freebies/tmake.html">tmake</a>
project file, or even an ordinary makefile.  Any file that contains

\dontinclude tt1/tt1.pro

\skip SOURCES
\line SOURCES
\skip TRANSLATIONS
\line TRANSLATIONS

will work. \e TRANSLATIONS specifies the message files we want to
maintain. In this example, we just maintain one set of translations,
namely Latin.

Note that the file extension is \c .ts, <i>not</i> \c .qm.  The \c .ts
translation source format is designed for use during the application's
development. Programmers or release managers run the 
<a href="#lupdate">lupdate</a> program to generate and update \c .ts
files with the source text that is extracted from the source code.
Translators read and update the \c .ts files using <em>Qt Linguist</em>
adding and editing their translations. The \c .ts format is
human-readable XML that can be emailed directly and is easy to put
under version control. 

Once the translations are complete the <a href="#lrelease">lrelease</a>
program is used to convert the \c .ts files into the \c .qm Qt message
file format. The \c .qm format is a compact binary format designed to
deliver very fast lookup performance. Both \e lupdate and \e lrelease
read all the project's source and header files (as specified in the
HEADERS and SOURCES lines of the project file) and extract the strings
that appear in \c tr() function calls.  

\e lupdate is used to create and update the message files (\c tt1_la.ts
in this case) to keep them in sync with the source code. It is safe to
run \e lupdate at any time, as \e lupdate does not destroy any
information.  For example, you can put it in the makefile, so the \c .ts
files are updated whenever the source changes.

Try running \e lupdate right now, like this:

\code
    lupdate tt1.pro
\endcode

You should now have a file \c tt1_la.ts in the current directory,
containing this

\code
    <!DOCTYPE TS><TS>
    <codec>iso8859-1</codec>
    <context>
        <name>QPushButton</name>
        <message>
            <source>Hello world!</source>
            <translation type='unfinished'></translation>
        </message>
    </context>
    </TS>
\endcode

You don't need to understand the file format since it is read and
updated using tools, e.g. \e lupdate and <em>Qt Linguist</em>.

<h4>Translating to Latin with Qt Linguist</h4>

We will use <em>Qt Linguist</em> to provide the translation, although
you can use any XML or plain text editor to enter a translation into a
\c .ts file. 

To start <em>Qt Linguist</em>, type

\code
    linguist tt1_la.ts
\endcode

You should now see the text "QPushButton" in the top left pane.
Double-click it, then click on "Hello world!" and enter "Orbis, te
saluto!" in the <em>Translation</em> pane (the middle right of the
window).  Don't forget the exclamation mark!

Click the \e Done checkbox and choose <em>File|Save</em> from the 
menu bar.  The \c .ts file will no longer contain

\code
    <translation type='unfinished'></translation> 
\endcode

but instead will have

\code
    <translation>Orbis, te saluto!</translation> 
\endcode

<h4>Running the Application in Latin</h4>

To see the application running in Latin, we have to generate a \c .qm
file from the \c .ts file. Generating a \c .qm file can be achieved
either from within <em>Qt Linguist</em> (for a single \c .ts file), or
by using the command line program \e lrelease which will produce one \c
.qm file for each of the \c .ts files listed in the project file.
Generate \c tt1_la.qm from \c tt1_la.ts by choosing
<em>File|Release</em> from <em>Qt Linguist's</em> menu bar and pressing
\e Save in the file save dialog that pops up. Now run the \e tt1 example
program again. This time the button will be labelled "Orbis, te
saluto!".

<em>Listing of file \link tt2-tt2-pro.html tt2.pro\endlink:</em>
\include tt2/tt2.pro

This example is a slightly more involved and introduces a key
<em>Qt Linguist</em> concept: "contexts". 

<ul>
<li> \link tt2-arrowpad-h.html arrowpad.h\endlink contains the
     definition of ArrowPad, a custom widget;
<li> \link tt2-arrowpad-cpp.html arrowpad.cpp\endlink contains the

<li> \link tt2-mainwindow-h.html mainwindow.h\endlink contains the
     definition of MainWindow, a QMainWindow subclass;
<li> \link tt2-mainwindow-cpp.html mainwindow.cpp\endlink contains the
     implementation of MainWindow;
<li> \link tt2-main-cpp.html main.cpp\endlink contains main().
</ul>

We will use two translations, French and Dutch, although there is no
effective limit on the number of possible translations that can be used
with an application. The relevant lines of 
\link tt2-tt2-pro.html tt2.pro\endlink are

\skip HEADERS
\until tt2_nl.ts

Run \e lupdate; it should produce two identical message files
\c tt2_fr.ts and \c tt2_nl.ts. These files will contain all the source
texts marked for translation with \c tr() calls and their contexts.

<h4>Line by Line Walk-Through</h4>

In \link tt2-arrowpad-h.html arrowpad.h\endlink we define the
ArrowPad subclass which is a subclass of
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qwidget.html">QWidget</a>.  In the
<em>Tutorial 2 Screenshot, English version</em>, above, the central
widget with the four buttons is an ArrowPad.

\dontinclude tt2/arrowpad.h
\skip class ArrowPad
\line class ArrowPad

When \e lupdate is run it not only extracts the source texts but it also
groups them into contexts. A context is the name of the class in which
the source text appears. Thus, in this example, "ArrowPad" is a context:
it is the context of the texts in the ArrowPad class.  The Q_OBJECT
macro defines \c tr(x) in ArrowPad like this

\code
    qApp->translate( "ArrowPad", x ) 
\endcode

Knowing which class each source text appears in enables <em>Qt
Linguist</em> to group texts that are logically related together, e.g.
all the text in a dialog will have the context of the dialog's class
name and will be shown together. This provides useful information for
the translator since the context in which text appears may influence how
it should be translated. For some translations keyboard
accelerators may need to be changed and having all the source texts in a
particular context (class) grouped together makes it easier for the
translator to perform any accelerator changes without introducing
conflicts.

In \link tt2-arrowpad-cpp.html arrowpad.cpp\endlink we implement the
ArrowPad class.

\dontinclude tt2/arrowpad.cpp
\skip QPushButton
\line QPushButton

We call \c ArrowPad::tr() for each button's label since the labels are
user-visible text.


<center><img src="images/tt2_en.png"
alt="Screenshot of the English version of tutorial 2">
<h5>Tutorial 2 Screenshot, English version</h5></center>

\dontinclude tt2/mainwindow.h
\skip QMainWindow
\line QMainWindow
\until Q_OBJECT

In the <em>Tutorial 2 Screenshot, English version</em>, above, the whole
window is a MainWindow.  This is defined in the \link
tt2-mainwindow-h.html mainwindow.h\endlink header file. Here too, we use
Q_OBJECT, so that MainWindow will become a context in <em>Qt
Linguist</em>.

In the implementation of MainWindow, 
\link tt2-mainwindow-cpp.html mainwindow.cpp\endlink,
we create an instance of our ArrowPad class

\dontinclude tt2/mainwindow.cpp
\skip arrow pad
\line arrow pad

We also call MainWindow::tr() twice, once for the menu item and once for
the accelerator

\skip quit()
\line quit()
\until stringToKey

Note the use of
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qaccel.html#7c073d">
QAccel::stringToKey()</a> to support different keys in other languages.
"Ctrl+Q" is a good choice for Quit in English, but a Dutch translator
might want to use "Ctrl+A" (for Afsluiten) and a German translator
"Strg+E" (for, strangely, Beenden). When using \c tr() for Ctrl key
accelerators the two argument form should always be used with the second
argument describing the function that the accelerator performs.

Our \c main() function is defined in 
\link tt2-main-cpp.html main.cpp\endlink as usual.

\dontinclude tt2/main.cpp
\skip QTranslator
\line QTranslator
\until install

We choose which translation to use according to the current
locale. <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qtextcodec.html#75defa">
QTextCodec::locale()</a> can be influenced by setting the <tt>LANG</tt>
environment variable, for example. Notice that the use of a naming
convention that incorporates the locale for \c .qm message files, (and
\c .ts files), makes it easy to implement choosing the translation file
according to locale.

If there is no \c .qm message file for the locale chosen the original
source text will be used and no error raised.

<h4>Translating to French and Dutch</h4>

We'll begin by translating the example application into French.  Start
<em>Qt Linguist</em> with \c tt2_fr.ts.  You should get the seven source
texts ("\&Up", "\&Left", etc.) grouped in two contexts ("ArrowPad" and
"MainWindow").

Now, enter the following translations:

<ul>
<li> ArrowPad
     <ul>
     <li> \&Up - \&Haut
     <li> \&Left - \&Gauche
     <li> \&Right - \&Droite
     <li> \&Down - \&Bas
     </ul>
<li> MainWindow
     <ul>
     <li> E\&xit - \&Quitter
     <li> Ctrl+Q - Ctrl+Q
     <li> \&File - \&Fichier
     </ul>
</ul>

It's quickest to press Alt+D (which clicks the <em>&Done & Next</em>
button) after typing each translation, since this marks the translation
as done and moves on to the next source text.

Save the file and do the same for Dutch working with \c tt2_nl.ts:

<ul>
<li> ArrowPad
     <ul>
     <li> \&Up - \&Boven
     <li> \&Left - \&Links
     <li> \&Right - \&Rechts
     <li> \&Down - \&Onder
     </ul>
<li> MainWindow
     <ul>
     <li> E\&xit - \&Afsluiten
     <li> Ctrl+Q - Ctrl+A
     <li> File - \&Bestand
     </ul>
</ul>

We have to convert the \c tt1_fr.ts and \c tt1_nl.ts translation source
files into \c .qm files. We could use <em>Qt Linguist</em> as we've done
before; however using the command line tool \e lrelease ensures that
<i>all</i> the \c .qm files for the application are created without us
having to remember to load and <em>File|Release</em> each one
individually from <em>Qt Linguist</em>. 

In practice we would include calls to \e lupdate and \e lrelease in the
application's make file to ensure that the latest translations were
always used automatically.

<font color="red">[[Arnt -- AN EXAMPLE OF A MAKEFILE OR .PRO FILE THAT
DID THIS WOULD BE NICE.]]</font>

Type

\code
    lrelease tt2.pro
\endcode

This should create both \c tt2_fr.qm and \c tt2_nl.qm.  Set the
<tt>LANG</tt> environment variable to <tt>fr</tt>.  In Unix,
one of the two following commands should work

\code
    export LANG=fr
    setenv LANG fr
\endcode

In Windows, either modify autoexec.bat or run

\code
    set LANG=fr
\endcode


When you run the program, you should now see the French version:

<center><img src="images/tt2_fr.png"
alt="Screenshot of the French version of tutorial 2">
<h5>Tutorial 2 Screenshot, French version</h5></center>

Try the same with Dutch, by setting <tt>LANG=nl</tt>. Now the Dutch
version should appear:

<center><img src="images/tt2_nl.png"
alt="Screenshot of the Dutch version of tutorial 2">
<h5>Tutorial 2 Screenshot, Dutch version</h5></center>

<h4>Exercises</h4>

Mark one of the translations in <em>Qt Linguist</em> as not done, i.e.
by unchecking the "done" checkbox; run \e lupdate, then \e lrelease,
then the example. What effect did this change have?

Set <tt>LANG=fr_CA</tt> (French Canada) and run the example program
again.  Explain why the result is the same as with <tt>LANG=fr</tt>.

Change one of the accelerators in the Dutch translation to eliminate the
conflict between \e &Bestand and \e &Boven.

<em>Listing of file \link tt3-tt3-pro.html tt3.pro\endlink:</em>
\include tt3/tt3.pro

We've included a translation file, 
\link tt3-tt3_pt-ts.html tt3_pt.ts\endlink, which contains some
Portuguese translations for this example.

We will consider two releases of the same application: Troll Print 1.0
and 1.1.  We will learn to reuse the translations created for one
release in a subsequent release.  (In this tutorial, you have to edit
some source files.  It's probably best to copy all the files to a
new temporary directory and work from there.)

Troll Print is a toy example application that lets the user choose
printer settings.  It comes in two versions: English and Portuguese.

Version 1.0 consists of these files:

<ul>
<li> \link tt3-printpanel-h.html printpanel.h\endlink contains the
     definition of PrintPanel;
<li> \link tt3-printpanel-cpp.html printpanel.cpp\endlink contains the
     implementation of PrintPanel;
<li> \link tt3-mainwindow-h.html mainwindow.h\endlink contains the
     definition of MainWindow;
<li> \link tt3-mainwindow-cpp.html mainwindow.cpp\endlink contains the
     implementation of MainWindow;
<li> \link tt3-main-cpp.html main.cpp\endlink contains main();
<li> \link tt3-tt3-pro.html tt3.pro\endlink is the \e tmake
     project file.
<li> \link tt3-tt3_pt-ts.html tt3_pt.ts\endlink is the Portuguese
     message file.
</ul>

<h4>Line by Line Walk-Through</h4>


The PrintPanel is defined in 
\link tt3-printpanel-h.html printpanel.h\endlink.

\dontinclude tt3/printpanel.h
\skip QVBox
\line QVBox
\until Q_OBJECT

PrintPanel is a <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qwidget.html">
QWidget</a>.  It needs the Q_OBJECT macro for \c tr() to work properly.

The implementation file is 
\link tt3-printpanel-cpp.html printpanel.cpp\endlink.

\dontinclude tt3/printpanel.cpp
\skip setSpacing
\skip /
\line /
\line
\line
\line


Some of the code is commented out in Troll Print 1.0; you will uncomment
it later, for Troll Print 1.1.

\dontinclude tt3/printpanel.cpp
\skip twoSided
\line twoSided
\until \} 

Notice the two occurrences of \c tr("Enabled") and of \c tr("Disabled")
in PrintPanel.  Since both "Enabled"s and "Disabled"s appear in the same
context <em>Qt Linguist</em> will only display one occurrence of each
and will use the same translations for the duplicates that it doesn't
display. Whilst this is a useful timesaver, in some languages, such as
Portuguese, the second occurrence requires a separate translation. We
will see how <em>Qt Linguist</em> can be made to display all the
occurrences for separate translation shortly.

The header file for the mainwindow,
\link tt3-mainwindow-h.html mainwindow.h\endlink, contains no surprises.
In the implementation, 
\link tt3-mainwindow-cpp.html mainwindow.cpp\endlink, we have some
user-visible source texts that must be marked for translation.

\dontinclude tt3/mainwindow.cpp
\skip setCaption
\line setCaption

We must translate the window's caption. 

\skip quit
\line quit
\until Help

We also need to translate the menu items. Note that the two argument
form of \c tr() is used for the keyboard accelerator, Ctrl+Q, since the
second argument is the only clue the translator has to indicate what
function that accelerator will perform. 

\dontinclude tt3/main.cpp
\skip QTranslator
\until installTranslator

The \c main() function in
\link tt3-main-cpp.html main.cpp\endlink, is the same as the one in
<a href="#Tutorial_2:_Making_User-Visible_Strings_Translate">Tutorial 2</a>. 
In particular it chooses a translation file based on the current locale.

<h4>Running Troll Print 1.0 in English and in Portuguese</h4>

We will use the translations in the 
\link tt3-tt3_pt-ts.html tt3_pt.ts\endlink file that is provided.

Set the <tt>LANG</tt> environment variable to <tt>pt</tt>, and then
run \c tt3.  You should still see the English version, as
shown in the <em>Tutorial 3 Screenshot, "Troll Print 1.0", English
version</em>, above. Now run \e lrelease, e.g. <code>lrelease
tt3.pro</code>, and then run the example again. Now you should see the
Portuguese edition (Troll Imprimir 1.0):

<center><img src="images/tt3_10_pt_bad.png"
alt="Screenshot of Troll Imprimir 1.0 (Bad Portuguese)">
<h5>Tutorial 3 Screenshot, "Troll Imprimir 1.0", (Bad) Portuguese version</h5>
</center>

Whilst the translation has appeared correctly, it is in fact wrong. In
good Portuguese, the second occurrence of "Enabled" should be
"Ativadas", not "Ativado" and the ending for the second translation of
"Disabled" must change similarly too. 

If you open \link
tt3-tt3_pt-ts.html tt3_pt.ts\endlink using <em>Qt Linguist</em>, you
will see that there is just one occurrence of "Enabled" and of
"Disabled" in the translation source file, even though there are two of
each in the source code. This is because <em>Qt Linguist</em> tries to
minimise the translator's work by using the same translation for
duplicate source texts. In cases such as this where an identical
translation is wrong, the programmer must disambiguate the duplicate
occurrences. This is easily achieved by using the two argument form of
\c tr().

We can easily determine which file must be changed because the
translator's "context" is in fact the class name for the class where the
texts that must be changed appears. In this case the file is 
\link tt3-printpanel-cpp.html printpanel.cpp\endlink, where the 
there are four lines to change.  Add the second argument "two-sided" in
the appropriate \c tr() calls to the first pair of radio buttons:

\code
    but = new QRadioButton( tr("Enabled", "two-sided"), twoSided );
    but = new QRadioButton( tr("Disabled", "two-sided"), twoSided );
\endcode

and add the second argument "colors" in the appropriate \c tr() calls
for the second pair of radio buttons:

\code
    but = new QRadioButton( tr("Enabled", "colors"), colors );
    but = new QRadioButton( tr("Disabled", "colors"), colors );
\endcode

Now run \e lupdate and open \c tt3_pt.ts with <em>Qt Linguist</em>.  You
should now see two changes.

First, the translation source file now contains <i>three</i> "Enabled",
"Disabled" pairs. The first pair is marked "(obs.)" signifying that they
are obsolete. This is because these texts appeared in \c tr() calls that
have been replaced by new calls with two arguments.  The second pair has
"two-sided" as their comment, and the third pair has "colors" as their
comment. The comments are shown in the <em>Source text and comments</em>
area in <em>Qt Linguist</em>.

Second, the translation text "Ativado" and "Desativado" have been
automatically used as translations for the new "Enabled" and "Disabled"
texts, again to minimise the translator's work. Of course in this case
these are not correct for the second occurrence of each word, but they
provide a good starting point.

Change the second "Ativado" into "Ativadas" and the second
"Desativado" into "Desativadas", then save and quit.  Run \e lrelease to
obtain an up-to-date binary \c tt3_pt.qm file, and run Troll Print (or
rather Troll Imprimir).

<center><img src="images/tt3_10_pt_good.png"
alt="Screenshot of Troll Imprimir 1.0 (Good Portuguese)">
<h5>Tutorial 3 Screenshot, "Troll Imprimir 1.0", (Good) Portuguese version</h5>
</center>

The second argument to \c tr() calls, called "comments" in <em>Qt
Linguist</em>, distinguish between identical source texts that occur in
the same context (class). They are also useful in other cases to give
clues to the translator, and in the case of Ctrl key accelerators are
the only means of conveying the function performed by the accelerator to
the translator.  

An additional way of helping the translator is to provide information on
how to navigate to the particular part of the application that contains
the source texts they must translate. This helps them see the context
in which the translation appears and also helps them to find and test
the translations. This can be achieved by using a \e TRANSLATOR comment
in the source code:
<pre>
    /* TRANSLATOR MainWindow

       In this application the whole application is a MainWindow.  
       Choose Help|About from the menu bar to see some text
       belonging to MainWindow.
    *&#47;
</pre>

Try adding these comments to some source files, particularly to dialog
classes, describing the navigation necessary to reach the dialogs. You
could also add them to the example files, e.g. 
\link tt3-mainwindow-cpp.html mainwindow.cpp\endlink and 
\link tt3-printpanel-cpp.html printpanel.cpp\endlink are appropriate 
files. Run \e lupdate and then start <em>Qt Linguist</em> and load in
\c tt3_pt.ts.  You should see the comments in the <em>Source text and
comments</em> area as you browse through the list of source texts.

Sometimes, particularly with large programs, it can be difficult
for the translator to find their translations and check that they're
correct.  Comments that provide good navigation information can save
them time: 

<pre>
    /* TRANSLATOR ZClientErrorDialog

	Choose Client|Edit to reach the Client Edit dialog, then choose
	Client Specification from the drop down list at the top and pick
	client Bartel Leendert van der Waerden.  Now check the Profile
	checkbox and then click the Start Processing button.  You should
	now see a pop up window with the text "Error: Name too long!".
	This window is a ZClientErrorDialog.
    *&#47;
</pre>


<h4>Troll Print 1.1</h4>

We'll now prepare release 1.1 of Troll Print.  Start your favorite text
editor and follow these steps:

<ul>
<li> Uncomment the two lines that create a QLabel with the text
     "\<b\>TROLL PRINT\</b\>" in
     \link tt3-printpanel-cpp.html printpanel.cpp\endlink.
<li> Word-tidying: Replace "2-sided" by "Two-sided" in
     \link tt3-printpanel-cpp.html printpanel.cpp\endlink.
<li> Replace "1.0" with "1.1" everywhere it occurs in
     \link tt3-mainwindow-cpp.html mainwindow.cpp\endlink.
<li> Update the copyright year to 1999-2000 in
     \link tt3-mainwindow-cpp.html mainwindow.cpp\endlink.
</ul>

(Of course the version number and copyright year would be consts or
#defines in a real application.)

Once finished, run \e lupdate, then open \c tt3_pt.ts in <em>Qt
Linguist</em>.  The following items are of special interest:

<ul>
<li> MainWindow
     <ul>
     <li> Troll Print 1.0 - marked "(obs.)", obsolete
     <li> About Troll Print 1.0 - marked "(obs.)", obsolete
     <li> Troll Print 1.0. Copyright 1999 Macroshaft, Inc. -
	  marked "(obs.)", obsolete
     <li> Troll Print 1.1 - automatically translated as
	  "Troll Imprimir 1.1"
     <li> About Troll Print 1.1 - automatically translated as
	  "Troll Imprimir 1.1"
     <li> Troll Print 1.1.  Copyright 1999-2000 Macroshaft,
	  Inc. - automatically translated as "Troll Imprimir 1.1.
	  Copyright 1999-2000 Macroshaft, Inc."
     </ul>
<li> PrintPanel
     <ul>
     <li> 2-sided - marked "(obs.)", obsolete
     <li> \<b\>TROLL PRINT\</b\> - unmarked, i.e. untranslated
     <li> Two-sided - unmarked, i.e. untranslated.
     </ul>
</ul>

Notice that \e lupdate works hard behind the scenes to make revisions
easier, and it's pretty smart with numbers. 

Go over the translations in MainWindow and mark these as "done".
Translate "\<b\>TROLL PRINT\</b\>" as "\<b\>TROLL IMPRIMIR\</b\>".
When you're translating "Two-sided", press the <em>Guess Again</em>
button to translate "Two-sided", but change the "2" into "Dois".

Save and quit, then run \e lrelease.  The Portuguese version
should look like this:

<center><img src="images/tt3_11_pt.png"
alt="Screenshot of Troll Imprimir 1.1 Portuguese version">
<h5>Tutorial 3 Screenshot, "Troll Imprimir 1.1", Portuguese version</h5>
</center>

Choose <em>Ajuda|Sobre</em>, (<em>Help|About</em>), to see the about box

<center><img src="images/tt3_11_about_pt.png"
alt="Screenshot of Troll Imprimir 1.1 About box Portuguese version">
<h5>Tutorial 3 Screenshot, About box, Portuguese version</h5></center>

If you choose <em>Ajuda|Sobre Qt</em>, (<em>Help|About Qt</em>), you'll
get an English dialog... oops! Qt itself needs to be translated.  See 
the Qt document 
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/i18n.html">"Internationalization with
Qt"</a> for details.

Now set <tt>LANG=en</tt> to get the original English version:

<h3><a name="Conclusion">Summary</a></h3>

These tutorials cover all that you need to know to prepare your Qt
applications for translation. 

At the beginning of a project add the translation source files to be
used to the project file and add calls to \e lupdate and \e lrelease to
the make file.

During the project all the programmer must do is wrap any user-visible
text in \c tr() calls, and use the two argument form for Ctrl key
accelerators, or when asked by the translator for the cases where the
same text translates into two different forms in the same context. The
programmer should also include \e TRANSLATION comments to help the
translator navigate the application.
