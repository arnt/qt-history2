<!--
    A feature is a set of components.
    A component is a set of files.
    Both features and components can have descriptions.
    Components don't have to belong to a feature (top level components).
    Only components can have default/required/hidden flags.
    Hidden components are implictly required (if they are truely optional
    then why not allow the user to optionally install the component).
    Required components are shown but can not be unselected.
    Default components are initially selected but can be deselected.
    Unmarked components are not initially selected but can be optionally selected.

    When the complete/full configuration is selected, the following are installed:
	All components marked as hidden
	All components marked as required
