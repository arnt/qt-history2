Critical
--------

Severe
------

Accelerators that have been set in a form can't be used in
designer anymore (e.g. a Alt-P in a form inhibits the Alt-P-
accelerator for the Preview menu).

Create->Template lists only container classes not form classes

No possibility to include custom templates in "New File" dialog
(Create->Template should have a file dialog)

The View Connections dialog (Edit->Connections) mustn't be blocking
(there should be a possibility to have an eye on existing
connections while designing)

Edit Connections dialog:
    Connect button should be disabled after a connection was created
    by clicking signal and slot (prevent double creations by
    pressing the Connect button in addition)

    To be consistent with the mouse way, marking signal and slot
    by keyboard must not require pressing Connect additionally
    to actually create the connection

Corrupted designerrc (Reggie)
    When the .designerrc is empty or corrupted designer crashes on
    startup

    Changes of TemplatePath in .designerrc have no effect

\n doesn't work in tooltips, whatsthis, etc. in preview mode, but when
uiced it does work.

Small
-----

When saving as and the filename already exists, ask if you really want
to override the existing file.

Cosmetic
--------

The File menu should have a Close entry for the current form

Wishlist
--------

Display the current size of a form in the property editor
