Critical
--------

Severe
------

Accelerators set in a form can't be used in
designer anymore (e.g. a Alt-P in a form inhibits the Alt-P-
accelerator for the Preview menu).

Create->Template lists only container classes not form classes

No possibility to include custom templates in "New File" dialog
(Create->Template should have a file dialog)

The View Connections dialog (Edit->Connections) mustn't be blocking
(there should be a possibility to have an eye on existing
connections while designing)

Edit Connections dialog:
    Connect button should be disabled after a connection was created
    by clicking signal and slot (prevent double creations by
    pressing the Connect button in addition)

    To be consistent with the mouse way, marking signal and slot
    by keyboard must not require pressing Connect additionally
    to actually create the connection.

    When the latter will be fixed it will be unclear why there
    is a Connect button at all (neither the signals nor the slots
    listbox allows multiple selections). 

Corrupted designerrc (Reggie)
    When the .designerrc is empty or corrupted designer crashes on
    startup

    Changes of TemplatePath in .designerrc have no effect

\n doesn't work in tooltips, whatsthis, etc. in preview mode, but when
uiced it does work.

Small
-----

When saving as and the filename already exists, ask if you really want
to override the existing file.

Cosmetic
--------

Double-clicked tools should be be distinguishable from single-clicked
tools (e.g. get a darker icon).

From the ergonomic point of view, the Pointer, Signals/Slots and
Tab Order tools are considerred an entity, thus should behave
the same way all three. From this follows that the Signals/Slots tool should
not switch off after the Edit Connections dialog is finished. 

The File menu should have a Close entry for the current form

Wishlist
--------

Display the current size of a form in the property editor
