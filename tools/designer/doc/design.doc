\title Design Overview

This overview discusses following design decisions:
<ul>
<li>Editing Forms (2 phases)
<li>Undo/Redo, Commands
<li>Property editing
<li>Saving/Loading
<li>Code generation
</ul>

<h2 align=center>Editing Forms</h2>

Creating a form in the Designer works normally in two steps:
<ol>
<li>Creating an placing widgets statically
<li>Putting groups of widgets in layouts
</ol>

So the first step works without any layouting which makes it easier to
implement it and easier to use when designing a dialog (no unexpected
jumping around of widgets, etc.). In this mode widgets can be
inserted, moved, resized, lowered, raised and removed. The widgets can
be selected and deselected and a mode similar to the Extended
Selectionmode.

In the second step the user can select groups of widgets and layout
them. It's possible to layout a group vertically, horizontally and in
a grid. It is not decided yet if layouting in a grid should be done by
an algorithm using some heuristics or by a more interactive way which
gives the user more control but is also a bit more work for the user.

<h2 align=center>Undo/Redo, Commands</h2>

Each action or command which can be done in the Designer (like
inserting a widget, etc.) has to be implemented as a command (derived
from \c Command, see command.h). So for each action which is done an
instance of the right command is created, executed and added to the
command history. Each \c FormWindow holds its own command history
which is used for Undo/Redo.
