New functionality
-----------------

MainWindow editing (Reggie)
    Creating a mainwindow with menubar, toolbar, statusbar and
    centralwidget. This can be done using the passiveInteractor and
    mainContainer concept in the designer's formwindow like done with
    QWizard. Menuu/Toolbar editing does not allow to add items, as
    this is done using actions, it only mut be possible to add widgets
    to toolbars and submenus and widgets to menus.
    As special editor of the mainwindow a dialog to create actions and
    change their properties has to be implemented. QMainWindow will
    offer an action editor which will support dragging actions between
    the editor and menu and toolbar. The designer will use that too to
    let the user set the initial action for the menu and toolbar.

Editing of Slots (Reggie)
    Should be possible to directly edit code for slots in the
    designer, so that one doesn't need to subclass always just to
    implement a slot. This is easy to do using QTextEdit.

Support for the database classes/widgets to build database forms (Dave, Reggie)

Dynamic creating of dialogs from XML (Reggie, Volker)
    Loading XML files and creating dialogs dynamically from that. This is exactly
    what we do in the designer when preview, so it is basically using that code
    and getting the designer dependencies out there. Also we need to have to dynamic
    customwidget stuff ready for that, so that customwidgets can be used. Access to
    the widgets by name is available through QObject::child( const char * ).

Add splitter support (Reggie)
    Same concept as tabwidgets
    (widgetOfContainer/containerOfWidget/passiveInteractor). Will be
    easy to do.
