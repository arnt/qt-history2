New functionality
-----------------

MainWindow editing (Reggie) #
    Creating a mainwindow with menubar, toolbar, statusbar and
    centralwidget. This can be done using the passiveInteractor and
    mainContainer concept in the designer's formwindow like done with
    QWizard. Menuu/Toolbar editing does not allow to add items, as
    this is done using actions, it only mut be possible to add widgets
    to toolbars and submenus and widgets to menus.
    As special editor of the mainwindow a dialog to create actions and
    change their properties has to be implemented. QMainWindow will
    offer an action editor which will support dragging actions between
    the editor and menu and toolbar. The designer will use that too to
    let the user set the initial action for the menu and toolbar.

Editing of Slots (Reggie)
    Should be possible to directly edit code for slots in the
    designer, so that one doesn't need to subclass always just to
    implement a slot. This is easy to do using QTextEdit.

Add splitter support (Reggie)
    Same concept as tabwidgets
    (widgetOfContainer/containerOfWidget/passiveInteractor). Will be
    easy to do.

Add QWidgetStack support (Reggie)
    Use code of tabwidget support to make a general widget stack
    support and make tabwidget support a special case of that.

Provide application interfaces for plugins (Reggie, Volker)
    Use property system to enable access to the designer components. This will
    be pretty much an action interface like in the test example.
    - data interface for file handling and global stuff
    - interfaces for propertyeditor, objecthierarchy and formlist
    - interface for formwindow

Extending existing functionality

QMsDev
   "c. (Request).  It would be nice to have a toolbutton that runs UIC  in
    the -subimpl, -subdecl modes, to generate  .H and .CPP files for
    a UI subclass.
    * Please prompt (file dialog) for the .UI file to use (like the
      current UIC toolbutton).
    * Please prompt for the subclass name (so that developers can use
      the [MyForm, MyFormImpl] convention or the [MyFormBase, MyForm]
      convention (or something else) for the parent and child classes.

      {Note: I started off using [MyForm,MyFormImpl], but then found
      I had to #include MyFormImpl.h in client DLLs -- this seems
      suboptimal (exposes implementation detail, which changes if I revise
      a class to use UIC), so I just changed to use [MyFormBase,MyForm]
      in all my .UI forms." (support/arc-07/15878)
