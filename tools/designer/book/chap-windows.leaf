\chapter Reference: Windows

\section1 Introduction

By default \QD starts up with three windows on the left hand side.
They are the \l{Project Overview Window}, the \l{Object Explorer
Window}, and the \l{Property Editor/Signal Handlers Window}. In
addition, \QD provides an Action Editor for creating actions for a
form's menus and menu items. This chapter explains each window in
detail.

\section1 Project Overview Window

This window lists all the files associated with the project. To open a
form or file single click it in the Files list. To rapidly switch
between forms and files, type the name of the file in the line edit
above the files list and \QD will perform an incremental search to show
any matching files or forms.

Right-click a file (or the project) to get a context menu of options,
for example, 'Open form' or 'Remove form from project'.

\section1 Object Explorer Window

The Object Explorer window lists the current form's widgets and slots.
The window contains two tabs, the Objects tab and the Members tab.

\section2 Objects Tab

Click the Widgets tab to view all the widgets for the current form.
The widgets are listed by name and class. Click a widget in the list
to highlight it in the corresponding form.

\section2 Members Tab

Click the Members tab to view the current form's slots, forward
declarations, includes, and class variables. The Members tab uses a
tree view to display its information. Items which have a '+' sign have
sub-items which are revealed by clicking the '+'. Right click any
item in the tree view to popup a context menu.

To edit or add slots, right click the Slots folder and select 'Edit'
to invoke the \Dialog{Edit Slots Dialog}. Right click the Public,
Protected, or Private subdirectories and click 'New' to invoke the
\Dialog{Edit Slots Dialog}. Right click a slot in the list to invoke a
menu with additional options for the slot. To add new slots, choose
'New' from the menu, which invokes the \Dialog{Edit Slots Dialog}. To
change the properties of the selected slot, choose 'Properties' which
invokes the \Dialog{Edit Slots Dialog}. To open the C++ editor and
jump to the implementation of the selected slot, choose 'Goto
Implementation'. To remove the selected slot, choose 'Delete'. Signals
can be added or deleted in the same way as slots.

Right click 'Forward Declarations', 'Includes (in declaration)',
'Class Variables', and 'Includes (in implementation)' to invoke a
context menu with the 'new' or 'edit' options. Choose 'New' to invoke
a line edit for typing a declaration, variable, or include. Right
click 'Forward Declarations' and choose 'Edit' to invoke the \Dialog
{Edit Forward Declarations Dialog}. Right click 'Includes (in
declaration)' and choose'Edit' to invoke the \Dialog {Edit Includes
(in Declaration) Dialog}. Right click 'Class variables' and choose
'Edit' to invoke the \Dialog {Edit Class Variables Dialog}. Right
click 'Includes (in Implementation)' and choose 'Edit' to invoke the
\Dialog {Edit Includes (in Implementation) Dialog}. 

\section1 Property Editor/Signal Handlers Window

Click the Property Editor/Signal Handlers window to view and change
the properties of forms, widgets and menus. This window has a
'Properties' tab and a 'Signal Handlers' tab.

\section2 The Properties Tab

Click the 'Properties' tab to change the appearance and behaviour of
the selected widget. (For menus, click the menu bar to show the menu
item properties in the Property Editor.) The Property Editor has two
columns, the Property column which lists property names and the Value
column which lists the values. Click the column headers to sort the
properties or values. Some property names have a plus sign '+' in a
square to their left; this signifies that the property name is the
collective name for a set of related properties.

Some properties have simple values, for example, the name property has
a text value, the width property (within minimumSize for example) has
a numeric value. To change a text value click the existing text and
type in your new text. To change a numeric value click the value and
either type in a new number, or use the spin buttons to increase or
decrease the existing number until it reaches the value you want. Some
properties have a fixed list of values, for example the mouseTracking
property is boolean and can take the values True or False. The cursor
property also has a fixed list of values. If you click the cursor
property or the mouseTracking property the value will be shown in a
drop down combobox; click the down arrow to see what values are
available.

Some properties have complex sets of values; for example the font
property. If you click the font property an ellipsis button (...) will
appear; click this button and a Select Font dialog will pop up which
you can use to change any of the font settings. Other properties have
ellipsis buttons which lead to different dialogs depending on what
settings the property can have. For example, if you have a lot of text
to enter for a text property you could click the ellipsis button to
invoke the multi-line text editor dialog. The names of properties
which have changed are shown in bold. If you've changed a property but
want to revert it to its default value click the property's value and
then click the red 'X' button to the right of the value. Some
properties have an initial value, e.g. 'TextEdit1', but no default
value; if you revert a property that has an initial value but no
default value (by clicking the red 'X') the value will become empty
unless the property, e.g. name, is not allowed to be empty.

The property editor fully supports Undo and Redo (Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y,
also available from the Edit menu).

\section1 Action Editor Window

The Action Editor window is used to create actions that the user
initiates through the user interface, for example, saving or printing a
file. To access the Action Editor window, click
\Menu{Window|Views|Action Editor} when a main window is active.

\img qd-actioneditor.png
\caption Action Editor

The Action Editor contains three functions on its menu bar: create,
delete, and connect. It also contains a listview that lists the
existing actions.

To create a new action, click the arrow on the Create a New Action
icon on the menu bar. Choose to create a new action, a new action
group, or a new dropdown action group. You can also create actions by
right-clicking an existing action in the Action Editor listview and
selecting the type of action you want to create from the popup menu.

To delete an action from the listview, click the action you want to
delete from the list, and then click Delete Current Action on the menu
bar. You can also delete actions by right-clicking an existing action
and in the Action Editor listview and then clicking Delete Action from the
popup menu. 
  
To connect an action to a slot, click an action on the listview and
then click the Connect icon on the menu bar to invoke the \Widget{View
and Edit Connections} dialog. You can also connect an action to a slot
by right-clicking an existing action and in the Action Editor listview
and then clicking Connect Action from the popup menu.
