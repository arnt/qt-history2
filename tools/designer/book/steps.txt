MAIN WINDOW CODE

VARIABLES ETC

We need to keep track of some variables: the colors, whether the data
has changed, whether a view needs updating etc.

Click the Members tab of the Object Explorer. Right click 'Class
Variables' (towards the bottom), and click Edit.

Click Add and enter 'QString m_filename;'. In a similar way add:
'QMap<QString,QColor> m_colors;', 'bool m_changed', 'bool
m_table_dirty', 'bool m_icons_dirty', 'QStringList m_comments;', 'bool
m_show_web'
and 'int m_clip_as'. Click Close to finish.

Right click Forward Declarations, then click Edit. Add the following
using the Add button. 'class QString;', 'class QColor;'

In a similar way add Includes (in Implementation):
'"qcolor.h"', '"qstring.h"'.h"' '"qpainter.h"' '"qapplication.h"'.

SIGNALS AND SLOTS

We want to show details of the current color in the status bar so we
must create some signal slot connections.

Click Edit|Connections to invoke the View and Edit Connections dialog.
Click New to create a new connection. Change the sender to colorTable, and
change the Signal to currentChanged(int,int). Change the receiver to
MainForm. We need to create a new slot (that we'll code later). Click
Edit Slots to invoke the Edit Functions dialog, and change the default
'newSlot()' name to 'changedTableColor(int,int)', then click OK. Now
change the Slot in the View and Edit Connections dialog to our new
changedTableColor slot.

Click New to create another connection. Change the sender to colorIconView
and change the Signal to currentChanged(QIconViewItem*). Change the
receiver to MainForm. Again, click Edit Slots, and create a new slot,
this time called called changedIconColor(QIconViewItem*). Change the
Slot in the View and Edit Connections dialog to the new
changedIconColor slot.

We also want to connect the widget stack's aboutToShow slot to our own
slot. Click New and change the sender to WidgetStack. Change the
Signal to aboutToShow(int) and change the receiver to MainForm.
Create a new slot called aboutToShow(int) and make this the Slot
that the widget stack's aboutToShow signal connects to.

We also need to connect up our view menu's action group. Click New and
change the sender to viewActionGroup. Change the Signal to
selected(QAction*). Change the receiver to MainForm. Create a new slot
called changeView(QAction*)  and make this the slot that the selected
signal connects to.



CODE

Click 'mainform.ui.h' in the Project Overview window.

Create the following consts:

<<no tick pixmap -- use QCheckTableItems instead>>

Create the init() function, the clearData() function and the populate()
function. Also colorSwatch(), isWebColor(), .

(Create main.cpp)
Click File|New, then click main.cpp. This invokes the Configure
Main-File dialog; the default form, MainForm is correct, so click OK.

Edit main.cpp to change the signal/slot connection from
    a.connect( &a, SIGNAL( lastWindowClosed() ), &a, SLOT( quit() ) );
to
    a.connect( &a, SIGNAL( lastWindowClosed() ), w, SLOT( fileExit() ) );

Do File|Save and try executing the project:
run qmake to generate the Makefile, then make then run 

Now we'll write our custom slots.

aboutToShow(int),
changedTableColor(row)
changedIconColor(QIconViewItem *)

and a new function changedColor(const QString&)
Because this updates the status bar we need to include (in
Implementation) "qstatusbar.h".

We now implement the file options, fileNew, fileOpen, fileSave and
fileSaveAs.  We need to declare "qregexp.h", "qmessagebox",
"qfiledialog.h" and "qfile.h". (The file format we are using for
colors is that used by the X Consortium.)


Now we'll implement the edit menu options.

We'll leave Add until the next chapter when we cover custom dialogs.

Now we'll implement editDelete().

Now editCopy().
Add QClipboard *clipboard to class variables and set it in init(). and
qclipboard.h to includes.

We don't do pasting so delete editPaste() from the object explorer.
Similarly delete editUndo() and editRedo(). After these deletions you
may need to make clean before making.

CHAPTER TWO Dialogs

ADD 
Before we can implement Add we must make a signal/slot connection.
Click Edit|Connections to invoke the View and Edit Connections dialog.
Click New and set the sender to be editAddAction, signal activated,
receiver, MainForm and slot (a newly created editAdd()).

We can use a standard dialog to get the user to choose a color, but we
need our own dialog to get the name of the color.

Click File|New, then click Dialog, then click OK. Drag a corner of the
form to make it smaller. Change the form's name to 'ColorNameForm' and
its caption to 'Color Form -- Color Name'. 
Click File|Save, then OK.

[Explain not having to worry about precise layout.]

Click the TextLabel tool in the Toolbox, then click of the form, on
the left hand side. Change this label's name property to colorLabel,
and delete the text in the text property. Click the pixmap property's
ellipsis button and choose the editraise.png image. Change the
scaledContents property to true and set the minimumSize property's
width and sub-property to 80.

Click the TextLabel tool again, and click on the form at the right of
the colorLabel, towards the top of the form. Change the text property
to '&Name'. Note that the ampersand is displayed; this is because we
haven't yet set a buddy [explain].

Click the LineEdit tool and click to the right of the 'Name' label.
Change the name property to 'colorLineEdit'. Click on the 'Name'
label, and change it's buddy property to 'colorLineEdit'.

Click the PushButton tool and click below the Name label. Change the
button's name to 'okPushButton', its text to OK and its default
property to True.

Click the PushButton tool again and click to the right of the OK
button. Change the button's name to 'cancelPushButton' and its text to
'Cancel'.

Now we're ready to lay out the form.

Click the form to deselect any selected widgets. 
Click the form above the Name label and drag so that the rectangle
touches both the Name label and the line edit; then release. Click the
Lay Out Horizontally toolbar button.

Click the form to deselect any selected widgets. 
Click the cancel button in the Object Explorer's
Objects tab. Shift+Click the OK button. Click the Lay Out Horizontally
toolbar button.

Click the form to deselect any selected widgets. 
Click Layout1 (which contains the Name label and line edit) in the
Object Explorer. Shift+Click Layout2 (which contains the buttons) in
the Object Explorer. Click the Lay Out Vertically toolbar button.

Click the form to deselect any selected widgets. 
Click the Lay Out Horizontally toolbar button to lay out the form.

Unfortunately, this stretches the buttons in a rather unattractive
way. We need the buttons to stay a reasonable width and have the
excess space consumed.

Click the red rectangle of Layout3 (that lays out the form), then
click the Break Layout toolbar button. Click one of the buttons and
click the Break Layout toolbar button. Roughly resize the OK button to
be half as wide, leaving space to its left. Click the Spacer toolbar
button, then click on the form to the left of the OK button, and drag
to the right a little, then release. This produces a horizontal
spacer. (If you slipped and got a vertical spacer, just change its
orientation property to vertical.)

Click the form to deselect any selected widgets. 
Click and drag from below the spacer so that the rectangle touches the
spacer and both buttons, then release. Click Lay Out Horizontally.

Click the form to deselect any selected widgets. 
Click Layout1 in the Object Explorer to select the name label and line
edit, and Shift+Click the layout (Layout4) that contains the spacer
and buttons. Click Lay Out Vertically.

Click the form to deselect any selected widgets. 
Click Lay Out Horizontally.

Now the buttons are laid out more pleasingly. Drag a corner of the
form to make it as small as possible. Now drag the form so that it is
a little higher and especially wider to make it more attractive.

Try previewing to see that the form looks good. (Ctrl+T). When you
preview try Tabbing to see the tab order. The tab order is almost
certainly correct (line edit, OK button, Cancel button). You can
change it by clicking the Tab Order toolbar (See the tab order sidebar).

[Tab order sidebar]

We want the user to be able to give the color they've chosen a name.
But we don't want to allow the name to be a duplicate of an existing
name. So we'll need a function that the caller can use to pass in the
list of color names, and a validation slot that is called when the
user clicks OK.

We'll start with the Cancel button since that's easiest. Click
Edit|Connections to invoke the View and Edit Connections dialog.

Click New. Change the Sender to cancelPushButton, signal to clicked()
and receiver to ColorNameForm and slot to reject(). Because this
functionality is achieved purely through signal and slot connections,
it will work in preview mode. Click OK to close the View and Edit
Connections dialog, then click Ctrl+T to preview. Clicking the Cancel
button will now close the dialog.

Click Edit|Connections to invoke the View and Edit Connections dialog.
Click New. Change the Sender to okPushButton, signal to clicked() and
receiver to ColorNameForm. Click the Edit Slots button to invoke the
Edit Functions dialog. Change the Function name to validate() and
click OK. Now change the slot to validate(). Click OK to close the
dialog.

Click colornameform.ui.h in the Project Overview window to invoke the
code editor.

Instead of adding in class variables and include files in the Object
Explorer's Members tab, we'll enter them straight into the .ui.h file.

Now well add the setColors() function that the caller must call to
provide the ColorNameForm with its list of color names.

And now we'll code the validate() slot.

Now that this dialog is complete we can write the code for the
editAdd() slot. We need to include qcolordialog.h and of course our
own colornameform.h. Also required are qlabel.h and qlineedit.h since
we refer to objects of these types. 

FIND

Just like the add dialog, we'll create the form, then add code to the
main window to make use of it.

Click File|New, then click Dialog, then click OK.

Drag a corner of the form to make it smaller. Change the form's name
to FindForm and its caption to 'Color Tool -- Find Color'. Click
File|Save, then OK.

Click the TextLabel tool and click on the form on the left hand side.
Change the text property to '&Look for'.

Click the LineEdit tool and click on the form to the right of the
'Look for' label. Change its name to findLineEdit. Click on the 'Look
for' label and change its buddy property to findLineEdit.

Click the PushButton tool and click on the form below the line edit.
Change its name to findPushButton and its text to '&Find'. Change its
default property to True.

Click the PushButton tool and click on the form to the right of the
'Find' button. Change its name to closePushButton and its text to
Close.

We know from experience with the ColorNameForm that we'll need a
spacer to the left of the buttons. Click the Spacer toolbar button,
then click the form to the left of the Find button and drag to the
right a little; then release. 

Click the spacer, then Shift+Click the Find button and Shift+Click the
Close button. Click Lay Out Horizontally.

Click the 'Look for' label, then Shift+Click the line edit. Click Lay
Out Horizontally.

Click the form, then click Lay Out Vertically. Drag a corner to reduce
the size of the form to make it more pleasing.

We're going to use this as a modeless dialog with all the
functionality performed in the main form; when the user clicks Find it
will emit a signal that we'll recieve and act upon. We'll also give it
a slot which we'll call if ther is no match.

Click Edit|Connections to invoke the View and Edit Connections dialog.

Click New. Change the Sender to closePushButton, signal to clicked(),
receiver to FindForm and slot to accept(). This will work in preview
mode; it will close the form when the user clicks Close.

Click New. Change the Sender to findPushButton, signal to clicked(),
receiver to FindForm. Click the Edit Slots button to invoke the Edit
Functions dialog. Change the Function's name to find(), then click OK.
Change the receiver's slot to find().

Click OK to close the View and Edit Connections dialog.

When the user clicks Find we want a signal to be emitted so that we
can look for the text. Click the Object Explorer's Members tab 
and right click Signals, then click New. Enter 'lookfor(const
QString&)'.

Now click findform.ui.h in the Project Overview. The implementation of
find() is trivial. We'll also implement a 'notfound' function. Simply
type it in; Designer will automatically update the Members tab.

Now we're ready to make use of the find form.

Click on mainform.ui.h in the Project Overview to invoke the code
editor. Add findform.h to the Includes, but this time in Includes (in
Declaration). In the class variables add
'FindForm *findForm;'. The implementation of editFind() is simple.
The code for our lookfor slot is straightforward. Enter the text into
Designer's code editor. We also need to update init() to set findForm
= 0.

By default designer makes functions that are typed in into public
functions. We need lookfor() to be a slot. Right click lookfor() in
Object Explorer's Members tab, then click Properties. This invokes the
Edit Function dialog. Change the Type to slot, then click OK.

The last functionality: the options dialog.

Click File|New, then click Dialog, then click OK.

Drag a corner of the form to make it smaller. Change the form's name
to OptionsForm and its caption to 'Color Tool -- Options'. Click
File|Save, then OK.

Click the GroupBox tool (in the Containers toolbox) and click towards
the top left of the form. Roughly drag the group box to make it wider.
Change its title to 'Table View'.

Click the CheckBox tool (in the Common Widgets toolbox) and click
inside the group box. Change the checkbox's name to webCheckBox and
its caption to 'Indicate &Web Colors'. Change its checked property to
True. Click the group box in Object Explorer's Objects tab, then click
Lay Out Horizontally.

Click the ButtonGroup tool and click below the table view group box.
Change this group's title to 'Copy to Clipboard As' and drag a corner
to make it a bit taller.

DOUBLE click the RadioButton tool to enter multiple placement mode.
Click inside the copy to clipboard group box near the top, then click
again below the first click then again below the second click so that
the group box contains three radio buttons. Click the Pointer toolbar
button to switch of multiple placement mode.

Click the first RadioButton. Change its name to hexRadioButton and its
text to '&Hex, e.g. #AB52F7'. Change its checked property to True.
Click the second RadioButton. Change its name to nameRadioButton and
its text to '&Name, e.g. light blue'.
Click the third RadioButton. Change its name to rgbRadioButton and
its text to '&RGB, e.g. 51,255,102'.

Click the ButtonGroup in Object Explorer (i.e. the one that contains
the radio buttons). Click Lay Out Vertically.

Click the PushButton tool and click on the form below the button
group. Change the button's name to okPushButton and its text to OK and
its default to True.

Click the PushButton tool and click to the right of the OK button.
Change this button's name to cancelPushButton and its text to Cancel.

Click the Spacer tool and click on the form to the left of the OK
button; drag to the right a little and release.

Shift+Click the okPushButton and Shift+Click the cancelPushButton so
that the Spacer and both buttons are selected. 

Click Lay Out Horizontally. Click the form, then click Lay Out
Vertically. Drag a corner to resize the form to an aesthetically
pleasing size.

This form will be modal and the caller will get and set its values.
All that we need to do is connect the OK button to accept() and the
Cancel button to reject(). 

Click Edit|Connections. 

Click New. Change the Sender to okPushButton, the signal to clicked(),
the receiver to OptionsForm and the slot to accept().

Click New. Change the Sender to cancelPushButton, the signal to clicked(),
the receiver to OptionsForm and the slot to reject().

Click File|Save.

Click on MainForm (mainform.ui) in the Project Overview to return to
the main form. 

Click Edit|Connections.

Click New. Change the sender to optionsAction, the signal to
activated, the receiver to MainForm. Click Edit Slots to invoke the
Edit Functions dialog.  Change the Function's name to editOptions()
and click OK. Change the slot to editOptions() then click OK.

We can now go to the code editor (click mainform.ui.h to invoke it)
and enter the code for editOptions(). We must also add optionsform.h,
qradiobutton.h and qcheckbox.h to our includes in implementation.

As a final refinement well implement two functions, loadSettings() and
saveSettings(), and add appropriate calls. We also add qsettings.h to
our includes.

Now the application is complete! 


[EXTRA HINTS AND TIPS in sidebars, e.g. multi-select, multi-click of a
tool for one click placement, etc.]
[MAKE SURE that everything covered by the old tutorial is covered by
the new; add sidebars for missing bits, e.g. deleting actions or
whatever.]
