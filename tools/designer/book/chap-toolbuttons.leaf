\section1 Introduction

\QD's toolbar buttons provide fast access to common functionality.
Toolbar buttons are grouped in several toolbars. Toolbars have a
handle at the left hand side which can be clicked to minimize the
toolbar. Toolbars that have been minimized have their handle appear
just under the menu bar; click the handle to restore the toolbar to
the last position it occupied. You can drag a toolbar's handle to
move the toolbar to a different position in the toolbar area. Toolbars
can be dragged out of the toolbar area entirely and made into
stand-alone tool dock windows. To hide a tool dock window click its close
button. To restore a hidden tool dock window, right click the tool area,
then click the name of the tool dock window you wish to restore.

\section1 The Tools Toolbar Buttons

The tools toolbar buttons are available through toolbars (as they have
always been prior to Qt 3.1), and also via the new Toolbox. From Qt
3.1, the tools toolbars are hidden and the Toolbox is shown. The
Toolbox is divided into groups, with the first group being "Common
Widgets" which contains the widgets you're likely to use most often.
If you prefer to use the original toolbar setup, you can access the
toolbars by clicking \Menu{Windows|Toolbars} and then selecting the
toolbars you want to be visible from the context menu. 

The Toolbox contains categories describing the type of toolbuttons you
can find within each catgory. Click a category name to access the
toolbuttons in that category. To use a widget in a category, click the
widget to activate it. Click the 'x' in the right hand corner of the
Toolbox to close it. To make the Toolbox appear again, click
\Menu{Window|Views|Toolbox}.

If you want to add the same kind of widget several times to a form,
for example, several push buttons, \e{double click} the widget's
toolbar button. After this, each time you click the form a new widget
will be added. Click the \Toolbutton Pointer toolbar button to leave
this mode.

the tab order, and continue until all the widgets have the tab order
