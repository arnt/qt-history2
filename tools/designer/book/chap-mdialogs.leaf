\chapter Reference: Dialogs

\section1 Introduction

This chapter describes and explains every \QD dialog.

\section1 The Menu Dialogs

\section2 Qt Designer New/Open Dialog

\img mw-startdesign.png
\caption Qt Designer New/Open 

Start up \QD to invoke the \Dialog{Qt Designer New/Open} dialog. This
dialog contains three tabs to use depending on what you want to do
once you start up \QD. 

\section3 The New File/Project Tab

This tab is the default when you start up \QD. Choose to start a new
project or to create a file by selecting the appropriate icon from the
window. For more information about the different file types available,
see the \l{The File Dialogs} section.

Click the "Don't show this dialog in the future" checkbox to hide the
dialog the next time you start up \QD.

\section3 The Open File/Project Tab

\img rd-startdesigntab2.png
\caption Open File/Project

Click this tab to open an already existing file or project. 
The tab shows the current directory and default file
type. To choose a different directory, click the 'Look In' combobox.
Choose a file and the name will appear in the 'File Name' combobox. To
choose a different file type, click the 'File Type' combobox. Click
the 'Create New Folder' toolbar button to create a new directory.
Click the 'List View' toolbar button to view folders and files in a
list with only the names showing. Click the 'Details' toolbar button
to view the folders and file names along with their size, type, date,
and attributes. Click the Size, Type, Date, or Attributes column
headers to sort the folders or files.

Click \OK to open the selected file. Click \CANCEL
to leave the dialog without opening a new file.

\section3 The Recently Opened Tab  

This tab displays all of the recently opened files or projects in a
window. Select a file or project and then click \OK to open it.

\section1 The File Dialogs

\img mw-newfile.png
\caption New File 

\target dialog-file-new
\section2  New File Dialog

Click \Menu File|New (or press \Key Ctrl+N) to invoke the \Dialog{New
File} dialog. This dialog offers four kinds of files to choose from: C++
Project, Forms, Source files, and Main files. 

The 'Insert Into' drop-down combobox lists the open projects,
defaulting to the current project. New files are added to the project
displayed in this combobox. To add a new file to a
different project, choose the project you want to use in the 'Insert
Into' combobox.

The 'Dialog' file type is highlighted by default when the \Dialog{New
File} dialog pops up. Click on the file type you want to use and click
\OK to create it. Click \CANCEL to leave the dialog without creating a
new file. Note that if you select C++ Project, the 'Insert Into'
combobox will be disabled, since it is not possible to insert a new
C++ Project into an existing project.

\section3 C++ Project Files

Click \Bold {C++ Project} to start a new project. This option invokes the
\l{Project Settings Dialog}. C++ projects are saved as \File .pro
files, which include the information \QD needs to manage projects.
When you add a form to your project in \QD, it is automatically added
to the FORMS section of the project file. The \File .pro file contains
the list of forms (\File .ui files) used in the project. \QD reads and
writes \File .ui files, e.g. form.ui. The uic (user interface
compiler) creates both a header file, e.g. form.h, and an
implementation file, e.g. form.cpp, from the \File .ui file. 

\section3 Dialog Forms

Click \Bold Dialog to create a plain dialog form. Typically, this type of
form is used to present the user with configuration 
options, or to present related sets of choices, for example, printer setting
dialogs and find and replace dialogs. 

\section3 Wizard Forms 

Click \Bold Wizard to create a wizard form. A wizard is a special type of
input dialog that consists of a sequence of dialog pages. A wizard's
purpose is to assist a user by automating a task by walking the user
through the process step by step. Wizards are useful for complex or
infrequently occurring tasks that people may find difficult to learn
or do. Initially the wizard form consists of a single dialog page. Use
the right click context menu to add additional pages and to change
page titles. 

\section3 Widget Forms 

Click \Bold Widget to create a form whose superclass is QWidget rather than
QDialog.

\section3 Main Window Form

Click \Bold{Main Window} to invoke the \l{Main Window Wizard}. This
wizard is used to create actions, menu options and toolbars through
which the user can invoke actions. This form is used to create typical
main-window style applications. 

\section3 Configuration Dialog Form 

Click \Bold {Configuration Dialog} creates a form with a listbox on
the left, and a tabwidget filling the body of the form, along with
Help, OK and Cancel buttons.

\section3 Dialog with Buttons (Bottom) Form  

The \Bold {Dialog with Buttons (Bottom)} form is a template with default
buttons at the bottom of the form.

\section3 Dialog with Buttons Form (Right)

The \Bold {Dialog with Buttons (Right)} form is a template with default
buttons at the right of the form.

\section3 Tab Dialog Form

The \Bold {Tab Dialog} form has a tab widget as its central widget,
along with Help, OK and Cancel buttons along the bottom.

\section3 C++ Source File 

Click \Bold {C++ Source File} to create a new empty C++ file. The file
will automatically be added to the project when it is saved.

\section3 C++ Header File

Click \Bold {C++ Header File} to create a new empty C++ header file.
The file will automatically be added to the project when it is saved.

\section3 C++ Main File

Click \Bold {C++ Main File} to invoke the \l {Configure Main-File
Dialog} which will create a basic \File main.cpp file automatically.
C++ Main file is not an option if you do not have a project open. In
addition, this file type is not avalable in the \Dialog{Qt Designer
New/Open} dialog because you cannot create a main.cpp file without
creating a project.

\target dialog-configure-main-file
\section4 Configure Main-File Dialog

\img rd-configmf.png
\caption Configure Main-File 

Click \Menu {File|New|C++ Main-File} to invoke the \Dialog{Configure
Main-File} dialog. Use this dialog to configure the main file and its
forms.

To change the default file name, type it in the 'Filename' line edit.
Choose the form to use as the application's main form from the line
edit by clicking it. 

Click \OK to accept the configurations and \QD will create a default
\File main.cpp file. Click \CANCEL to leave the dialog.

Note for database programmers: If you create a \File main.cpp file
using \QD, this file will \e not include the \Func createConnections()
function. We do not include this function because it needs the
username and password for the database connection, and you may prefer
to handle these differently from our simple example function. As a
result, applications that preview correctly in \QD will not run unless
you implement your own database connections function.

\target dialog-file-open
\section2 File Open Dialog

\img rd-open.png
\caption File Open 

Click \Menu File|Open (or press\Key Ctrl+O) to invoke the

\section1 The Edit Dialogs

\target dialog-edit-slots
\section2 Edit Functions Dialog

\img qs-editfunc.png
\caption Edit Functions

Click \Menu{Edit|Slots} to invoke the \Dialog{Edit Functions} dialog. Use this
dialog to edit or create slots and functions which are used in conjunction with
signals to provide communication between objects.

When this dialog is invoked, all existing slots and functions are
shown in the listview. The column headers Function, Return Type,
Specifier, Access, Type, and In Use provide details about each
function that is listed. Click on any of the column headers to sort
the functions. To create a new function, click the \Button{New
Function} button. The new function has a default name that you should
replace by typing the new name in the 'Function' line edit. The
'Return Type' is also a default that can be changed by typing in the
line edit. To change the 'Specifier' or 'Access', click the combobox
and choose the required specifier or access. To change the type of a
function (function or slot), click the Type combobox. To remove a
function, click the function you want to delete, and then click the
\Button{Delete Function} button.

Click \OK to save all changes made to the functions. Click \CANCEL to leave
the dialog without making any changes to the functions.   

\target dialog-view-connections
\section2 View and Edit Connections Dialog 

\img qs-editconn1.png
\caption View and Edit Connections

Click \Menu{Edit|Connections} to invoke the \Dialog{View and Edit
Connections} dialog. This dialog is also accessed by right-clicking
any of the widgets. Use this dialog to view and edit signal and slot
connections.

When this dialog is invoked, all existing connections are shown in the
listbox. The column headers Sender, Signal, Receiver, and Slot provide
details about each connection. Click the column headers to sort the
connections. To add a new connection, click the \Button New button. To
specify the Sender, Signal, Receiver, and Slot of the connection,
click the appropriate fields in the connection and select from the
combobox. To delete connections, select the connection(s) and then click the

\target dialog-edit-form-settings
\section2 Form Settings Dialog

\img rd-formset.png
\caption Form Settings

Click \Menu{Edit|Form Settings} to invoke the \Dialog{Form Settings}
dialog. Use this dialog to save the form's settings, pixmap, and
layout properties. 

\section3 Settings

In the Settings section, you can change or add the name of the class
that will be created by typing in the 'Class Name' line edit. Note
that the default name is the form name, but it can be changed. You can
also enter text to the 'Comment' and 'Author' line edits or leave them
blank, since they are not required.

\section3 Pixmaps

The default (for projects) is 'Project Imagefile'. This is the
recommended option. Images are handled automatically, with \QD storing
the images in a subdirectory, and \Cmd uic producing code that
contains the images and the necessary supporting code. Each image is
stored just once, no matter how many forms it is used in. 

If you do not want \QD to handle the images, (or are not using a
project) choose either 'Save Inline' or 'Use Function'. 'Save Inline'
saves the pixmaps in the \File .ui files. The disadvantage of this
approach is that it stores images in the forms in which they're used,
meaning that images cannot be shared across forms. Click 'Use
Function' to use your own icon-loader function for loading pixmaps.
Type the function's name (with no signature) in the 'Use Function'
line edit. This function will be used in the generated code for
loading pixmaps. Your function will be called with the text you put in
the pixmap property (e.g. the image name) whenever an image is
required. 

\section3 Layouts

Click the 'Default Margin' spinbox or the 'Default Spacing' spinbox to
change the default layout settings of the current form. 

To use the functions in the generated code to dynamically retrieve
values for the layout's default margin and spacing, check the Use
Functions chechbox. In the Margin and Spacing line edits, specify the
function names (no signatures or parantheses) which should be used to
retrieve the margin and spacing.  

\omit ###If you don't want to specify hardcoded values for the layout's default
margin and spacing, but want to use functions in the generated code to
retrieve these values dynamically, check the use functions checkbox
ans specify the function names (only the function name, no signature
or parantheses) which should be used to retrieve the
margin and spacing in the margin and spacing line edits.#######

Click \OK to accept changes to the form settings. Click \CANCEL to leave the
dialog without making any changes.

\target dialog-edit-preferences
\section2 Preferences Dialog 

Click \Menu{Edit|Preferences} to invoke the \Dialog Preferences
dialog. This dialog has a tab for 'General' preferences. If you have
the C++ Editor plugin, the dialog will also have a tab for the C++
Editor.

\section3 General Tab

\img rd-prefgen1.png
\caption Preferences- General Tab

The 'General' tab has sections for Background, Grid, General, and
Toolbars. 

The Background section defaults to 'Pixmap'. To change the default, click the
\Button {Select a Pixmap} button next to the 'Pixmap' radio button to invoke
the \Dialog{Choose a Pixmap... Dialog}. Click the 'Color' radio button
to change the background to a color instead of a pixmap. Click the
\Button {Choose a Color} button located to the right of the 'Color'
radio button to invoke the \Dialog{Select Color Dialog}.

The 'General' section of the General tab has three checkboxes that are
checked by default. Click the 'Restore last workspace on startup'
checkbox to save the size and positions of the windows and toolbars of
\QD. The next time you start up \QD, the windows and toolbars are
restored to their last positions. Click the 'Show Splash Screen on
startup' checkbox to display the \QD splash screen when you start up
the application. Click the 'Disable Database Auto-Edit in Preview'
checkbox to disable the ability to update or delete data in the
database to which you are connected when working with database
widgets. To change the path \QD uses to find it's online
documentation, click the 'Documentation Path' line edit and type a new
path. It would be unlikely to have to change this path. Another way to
change the path is to click the \Button {(ellipsis)} button located
to the right of the line edit. This invokes the \Dialog{Find Directory
Dialog}.

The 'Grid' section has options for customizing the grid on the form. The
'Show Grid' checkbox located above the 'Grid' section is checked by
default. Developers using \QD almost always use Qt's layouts to design
their forms and rarely make any use of the grid. The grid is provided
for the rare occasions when a form is created using widgets with fixed
sizes and positions. When 'Show Grid' is checked, you can customize
the grid's appearance. When it is unchecked, the 'Grid' section is
disabled. The 'Snap to Grid' checkbox is also checked by default.
When it is checked, widgets are placed on a dot (snap to the grid)
using the X|Y resolution. When it is unchecked, the 'Grid-X' and
'Grid-Y' spin boxes are disabled. Click the 'Grid X' and 'Grid Y'
spinboxes to customize the grid settings for all forms.

The 'Toolbars' section has a 'Show Text Labels' checkbox. Click the
checkbox to display the text labels for each icon shown in the \QD
toolbar.

\section3 C++ Editor Tab

\img rd-prefedit1.png
\caption Preferences- C++ Editor Tab

The C++ Editor tab provides options for customizing the editor. The
'Syntax Highlighting' section lets you change the way the syntax is
viewed in the editor. Click the 'Element' listbox and choose an
element. Click the 'Family' listbox to change the font style for that
element. Click the 'Size' spinbox to choose a font size. You can
change the font to Bold, Italic, or Underline by clicking the
corresponding checkbox. Note, that all the fonts used derive from the
'Standard' element, so if you want to change the font used for
everything, change the 'Standard' element. Click the \Button Color
button to invoke the \Dialog{Select Color Dialog}. As you make changes
to each element, you can view the changes in the 'Preview' line edit.

The 'Options' section has the Wordwrap, Completion, and Parentheses
Matching checkboxes checked by default. Click the checkboxes to
de-select them.  

Click \OK to accept changes to \Dialog Preferences dialog. Click
\CANCEL to leave the dialog without making any changes.

to a database or to edit the current connections.

Click \Button {New Connection} to create a new database connection.
For applications that use a single database it will probably be most
convenient to use the default connection name of '(default)'. If you
use more than one database then each one must be given a unique name.
A driver must be chosen from the Driver combo box. The database name
may be available in the Database Name combo box or may have to be
typed in. The database name, username, password and hostname should be
provided by your database system administrator. When the Connection

\target dialog-edit-custom-widgets
\section2 Edit Custom Widgets Dialog

The \Dialog{Edit Custom Widgets} dialog is invoked by clicking \Menu
{Tools|Custom|Edit Custom Widgets}. Use this dialog to create custom
widgets.

Custom widgets are created in code. They may contain a combination
of existing widgets but with additional functionality, slots and
signals, or they may be written from scratch, or a mixture of both. A
custom widget is often a specialization (subclass) of another widget
or a combination of widgets working together or a blend of both these
approaches. If you simply want a collection of widgets in a particular
configuration it is easiest to create them, select them as a group,
and copy and paste them as required within \QD. Custom widgets
are generally created when you need to add new functionality to
existing widgets or groups of widgets. To add create a new widget,
click the \Button {New Widget} button. You will find more information
about adding new widgets in the 'Definitions Section'. To load a file
which contains descriptions of custom widgets, click the \Button {Load
