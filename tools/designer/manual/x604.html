>We promised you earlier that we would fix the position
		of the extra cheese checkbox by centering it. One way do to
		that is using so-called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>spacers</I
>.</P
><P
>You can think of a spacer as a spring that has the power
		to move a block (a widget), but not to deform it. So, if you
		have a row layout containing two widgets, and you put a spacer
		in between them, the widgets will be pushed to the left and
		right sides as far as possible, but they will still keep their
		original size. If the user makes the dialog wider, the spring
		will take up the additional space, and if he or she makes it
		smaller, the spring shrinks accordingly.</P
><P
>Perhaps you can already guess how we can use spacers to
		center the extra cheese checkbox.		not use a spacer, but AlignCenter instead. Where has that gone
		to?		since the two spacers (springs) have equal strength, they will
		keep the checkbox always in the middle of the form.</P
><P
>To start from the previous, completely layouted form,
		you first have to break the two outermost layouts. Then make
		the extra cheese checkbox a bit smaller and move it a bit to
		the right so that there is space left to it.</P
><P
>Now select <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Layout/Add Spacer</SPAN
> from the
		menubar or click on the spacer icon (see <A
HREF="x604.html#QT-DESIGNER-ICON-SPACER"
>Figure 4-11</A
>) and insert two spacers
		left and right of the checkbox. Once you try to insert a
		spacer, a tiny popup menu will open and ask you whether the
		spacer should be horizontal or vertical. Since we are talking
		about horizontal orientation here, select horizontal both
		times. Your form should now look roughly like in <A
HREF="x604.html#QT-DESIGNER-FIG-LAYOUTTUTSTEP9"
>Figure 4-12</A
>.</P

>Next make a row out of the two spacers and the checkbox
		by selecting all three of them and assigning a horizontal
		layout. The result (cf. <A
HREF="x604.html#QT-DESIGNER-FIG-LAYOUTTUTSTEP10"
>Figure 4-13</A
>) will probably not
		be what you expected, but this problem will go away
		automatically in a minute.</P

><P
>Now recreate the outer two layouts that you had to break
		in order to be able to add the spacers: Assemble the three
		rows into a vertical layout, adjust the size of the form and
		assign a grid layout to the form. Change into test mode and
		see how the extra cheese checkbox always stays in the
		center (see <A
HREF="x604.html#QT-DESIGNER-FIG-LAYOUTTUTSTEP11"
>Figure 4-14</A
>).</P

>Of course, there are many more things you can do with
		spacers. Look for example at the size button group. Perhaps
		you think that it looks ugly at that the three radiobuttons
		should be evenly spaced across the button group. If you want
		this, just put spacers between the radiobuttons. If you add
		another two spacers above the first and below the last
		radiobutton, the remaining space will be evenly distributed
		above, between and below the radiobuttons. Or, you could
		decide that you want them close together, but in the lower
		part of the button group. In this case, just use one spacer
		and put it on top of the radiobuttons. As you can see, spacers
		give you a lot of possibilities.</P
><P
>There are more things you can do with layouts. We
		haven't really talked about grid layouts yet, and not about
		the various properties that the layout managers themselves
		have. You'll learn more about this in <A
HREF="qt-designer-sec-layoutmanagement.html"
>the section called <I
>All About Layout Management</I
> in Chapter 5</A
