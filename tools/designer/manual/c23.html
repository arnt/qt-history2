>Chapter 1. What Do You Need A GUI Designer For?</A
></H1
><P
>If you have some experience with GUI programming under
	  your belt, you might ask why you should use a GUI designer in
	  the first place. After all, you have written lots of dialogs
	  yourself, without any help of these new-fashioned code
	  generators, GUI builders, and what-nots. Aren't these things for
	  newbies only, for people who never learned to get their hands
	  dirty in a text editor, a real programmer's best friend?</P
><P
>You might at least be partially right here. If you are
	  really good at writing dialogs by hand, know the Qt layout
	  system in and out and are generally a good and quick code
	  anyway, you might be just as fast if you write your dialogs
	  yourself. But hands on your heart: You <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>are</I
>
	  sometimes using pencil and paper to draw a sketch of your
	  dialog, aren't you? Then why not let the Qt Designer be your
	  pencil and paper? You spare the expense and the trouble with a
	  rubber and can save a few trees.</P
><P
>Another thing: Even if you are very good, your dialogs do
	  not always look like you want them to when you compile and run
	  your program for the first time. So it's back to the editor,
	  fixing whatever needs fixing, recompile, relink, and
	  restart. Using a good GUI builder shortens this development
	  circle a lot, because it has a preview mode that lets you see
	  your dialog &#8220;for real&#8221; right away, without any
	  compiling.</P
><P
>Perhaps you like the general idea of a GUI builder, and
	  you have already tried some, but felt that they were decreasing
	  your productivity rather than increasing it. The GUI builder
	  may have been written to support a different work or design style
	  than yours, or it may just have been plain bad. Having an
	  expensive-looking case or four-color ads in famous programming
	  magazines does not necessarily mean that the tool is actually
	  any good.</P
><P
>If this description fits you, I suggest you give the Qt
	  Designer a try. It is a well-crafted tool that does not press
	  you into any specific design style, supports all Qt widgets as
	  well as your own and especially gets you a long way with those
	  pesky layout managers.</P
><P
>There is another reason why you might want to use or even
	  advocate the use of a GUI builder in your organization: In large
	  organizations, there are usually different groups working on the
	  design of the dialogs in an application and on the actual
	  implementation. The designers know a lot about user interface
	  design and usability issues, but not necessarily enough about
	  programming to write at least the skeletons of the dialogs
	  themselves. Without a GUI builder, the usual way is that the
	  designers draw the dialogs, either on a sheet of paper or with a
	  drawing program, and the programmers then try to implement this
	  design as close to the draft as possible. With a GUI builder, on
	  the other hand, the designers can just design the dialogs in the
	  GUI builders, click on the &#8220;Generate&#8221; button (or
	  whichever means for code generation the GUI builder provides), and
	  the code is already written &#8212; and the programmers can
	  concentrate on more creative jobs. Heck, if you are a
	  programmer, you do not even need to tell the designers about the
	  &#8220;Generate&#8221; button &#8212; just ask them to save
	  their design, take the file, load it into the GUI builder and
	  click that &#8220;Generate&#8221; button yourself. The designers
	  and your boss will think that it takes you half a day to
	  implement a dialog design, while it actually only takes you five
	  seconds, and you can play Quake the rest of the time.</P
><P
>We hope that we have convinced you that it is worthwhile
	  to make yourself familiar with the Qt Designer. To ease your
	  first steps with this tool, we will guide you through some
	  simple steps in next few chapters that teach you the basics of
	  Qt Designer. Further chapters will then teach you all the ins
	  and outs.</P
