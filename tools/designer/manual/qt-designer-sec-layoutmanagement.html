NAME="QT-DESIGNER-SEC-LAYOUTMANAGEMENT"
>All About Layout Management</A
></H1
><P
>We have done quite a bit with layout managements in the
tutorial chapters already, but here we will wrap up the missing pieces
of information and provide you with an overview of how to use layout
management in the Qt GUI Designer.</P
><P
>Remember that you use layout management in two steps:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Add widgets to your form.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Layout your widgets by assigning a layout manager to
the surrounding container.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>If you later want to add more widgets, you will have to
remove a layout manager ("break the layout") in order to be able to do
so. But even then, this two-step model stays valid: First you add the
new widget, then you re-assign the layout manager to the surrounding
container.</P
><P
>Note that there are two ways of selecting the
surrounding container: If you already have a natural surrounding
widget like a group box for the contained radio buttons or the form
itself in case you want to layout all already existing widgets or
layout managers, then you just click on this container and assign the
layout manager by using one of the options from the
<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Layout</SPAN
> menu, the toolbar buttons or the accelerators
(<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Ctrl-H</B
>), <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Ctrl-L</B
>, and
<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Ctrl-G</B
>, respectively).</P
><P
>If on the other hand you do not have a natural
container, e.g., because you just want to group a number of widgets
together so that you can later take this group as a whole when you
add another layout manager, then you can just have Qt GUI Designer
create a widget for you. You do this by simply selecting all the
widgets that should be layouted and then assign a layout manager. The
rest will be handled internally by Qt GUI Designer; in the generated
code, this will simply be a sublayout.<A

><P
>As you already know, there are three different layout
managers available: a vertical box layout manager that arranges its
widgets in a column, a horizontal box layout manager that arranges its
widgets in a row, and a grid layout manager that arranges its widgets
in a grid. Obviously, the vertical and the horizontal box layout
manager only differ in their orientation, otherwise they are
identical. Also, the two box layout managers are often used together;
it makes for a very natural layout to group some widgets into e.g., a
few rows, then group these rows into a few columns, group these
columns into even less rows, etc. Often, the outermost layout manager
is a vertical box layout manager, but this depends on your forms, of
course.</P
><P
>The grid layout manager, on the other hand, is less
flexible. It arranges its widgets in a fixed number of rows and
columns. While all the columns can have a different width, all the
widgets in one column automatically get the same width (otherwise you
could hardly speak of a column). The same goes for rows. If you really
want a widget not to extend its width to the full column width (which is
determined by either the widest widget or the available total space or
both), you can use spacers left and right to the widget that take up
the remaining space. Again, the same goes for rows, you can put
spacers on top and below a widget as well.</P
><P
>If you are unsure about whether you should use a grid
layout or a combination of vertical and horizontal box layouts, think
about what feels more natural, given the nature of the widgets. If you
have, e.g., a data-entry form where you have a number of vertically
arranged line-entry fields each of which have a label left to them,
the grid is probably the better option, because all the rows, each
consisting of a label and a line-entry field, are uniform and should
be layouted the same. If you, on the other hand, have a less uniform
collection of widgets, the more flexible solution of nested box
layouts might yield better results.</P
><P
>We have already hinted at the existence of spacers, and
you have used them a bit in the tutorial chapters we well. Spacers are
"things" that are not visible in the final dialog, except for the fact
that they take up some of the available space. As mentioned, this is
useful, if you do not want the widgets in a layout to claim all the
available space for themselves as this would make them look
unnaturally big. Spacers are represented by the spring-like drawing in
the form editor and can be either horizontal or vertical &#8212; you
have to select the orientation when you insert them, but can change it
later.</P
><P
>Spacers are one of the things that can be used rather
easily and intuitively, but that are awkward to describe. Therefore,
we will not make too many words about them here, but rather suggest
that whenever you think that a widget takes up more space than it
should and whenever you think that two widgets should be more
separated than they currently are, you insert a spacer between
them.</P
><P
>As all other things that you put on a form, layouts have
properties. If you select a layout (make sure that you really select
the layout and not one of the contained widgets or sublayouts; the
handles should be all around the red rectangle symbolizing the
layout), you can see the layout's properties in the form
editor. Layouts have much less properties than widgets, and most of
them are pretty generic anyway, but there are two properties that you
might want to change: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutSpacing</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutMargin</TT
>.
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutSpacing</TT
>, whose value is 6 by default,
indicates how much space there should be between the individiual
widgets or sublayouts in this layout. The default value of 6 is chosen
because that's what Microsoft recommends in its user-interface
guidelines.<A
NAME="AEN767"
HREF="#FTN.AEN767"
>[2]</A
> For other platforms, you
might want to choose different values. Also, you might have special
needs that call for more or less space between the widgets. In these
cases, change the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutSpacing</TT
> property.</P
><P
>Note that there is a significant difference between the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutSpacing</TT
> property and spacers. The
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutSpacing</TT
> property specifies how much space
there <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
> be between two widgets. For example,
if you have three widgets in a horizontal box layout, the width that
is required for this layout is the widths of all three widgets added
together plus two times the value of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutSpacing</TT
> property. There is no way the layout
can display itself and its widgets correctly if it gets less than this
width. Spacers, on the other hand, take up additional available space
that would otherwise go to the widgets. If the container that
surrounds our horizontal box layout can provide more horizontal
space, then either the widgets take up this space, or, if there are
spacers in between them, the spacers take up this space. In the latter
case, the space between the widgets will of course be more than the
required minimum that is specified by the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutSpacing</TT
> property.</P
><P
>The second property, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>layoutMargin</TT
>, is
less often used; its default is 0. It specifies an additional margin
that should be around all the widgets and sublayouts in the
layout. After the necessary widths and heights for all the widgets and
sublayouts in the layout have been computed, two times this value is
added to both the width and the height to get the final necessary
width and height of the layout. This property can be used if two
sublayouts would otherwise be too close together to look good, but you
will really need it very rarely only.</P
