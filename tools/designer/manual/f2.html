>&#13;    This manual presents <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
>, a tool for designing and implementing user
    interfaces built with the Qt cross-platform application development
    framework. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
> makes it easy to
    experiment with user interface design. At any time you can generate the
    code required to reproduce the user interface from the files <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
> produces,
    changing your design as often as you like. If you used the previous
    version you will find yourself immediately productive in the new version
    since the interface is fundamentally unchanged. But you will find new
    widgets and new and improved functionality which have been developed as a
    result of your feedback.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
> helps you build user interfaces with layout tools that move and
    scale your widgets (<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>controls</I
> in Windows terminology) automatically at
    runtime. The resulting interfaces are both functional and attractive,
    comfortably suiting your users operating environments and preferences. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
>
    supports Qt's signals and slots mechanism for type-safe communication
    between widgets. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
> includes a code editor which you can use to embed
    your own custom slots inside the generated code. Those who prefer to
    separate generated code from hand crafted code can continue to use the
    subclassing approach pioneered in the first version of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    The manual is divided into two parts. The first part, chapters one
    to seven, consists of tutorials which introduce you to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
> by
    leading you through the development of example applications. The
    second part, chapters eight to ten, provide a comprehensive
    reference to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
>. The tutorial chapters are written to be as self-contained
    as possible, but all of them assume that you are familiar with the
    material in chapter one which covers the basics of building a Qt
    application with Designer. Here's a brief overview of the chapters:
    <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Chapter one introduces <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
> and takes you step by step through the
    creation of a small but fully functional application. Along the way
    you will learn how to create a form and add widgets to it. In the
    course of the chapter you will use the form and property editors to
    customize the application, and learn how to lay out a form using the
    layout tools. You'll also learn how to use Qt's signals and slots
    mechanism and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
>'s built-in code editor to make the application
    functional. We will also explain how to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>qmake</B
> to generate
    a Makefile so that you can compile and run the application. 
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    In chapter two we will create a simple text editor. Through writing
    this application you will learn how to create a main window with menus
    and toolbars. We will see how to use Qt's built-in functionality to
    handle common tasks (e.g. copy and paste handling), and how to
    create our own functionality for our own menu items and toolbar
    buttons.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Chapter three will show you how to subclass a form; this allows you
    to clearly separate the user interface from the underlying code that
    implements its functionality. Additional information on <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>qmake</B
>
    and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uic</B
> is included in this chapter. This chapter will also
    explain how you can dynamically load dialogs from 
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ui</TT
> files into your application
    using <TT
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>QWidgetFactory</TT
> and how to access the
    widgets and sub-widgets of these dialogs. 
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Chapter four introduces some of Qt's more advanced widgets.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Chapter five explains how you can create your own custom widgets.
    Both the simple method, that was introduced with the first version of
    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
>, and the new more powerful method using plugins, are explained.
    </P

><LI
><P
>    Chapter six introduces Qt's SQL classes and takes you through an
    example that demonstrates how to execute SQL queries and how to set
    up master-detail relationships, perform drilldown and handle foreign
    keys.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Chapter seven focuses on <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
> itself, showing you how to customize
    Designer, how to integrate Designer with IDEs and how to create
    Makefiles. 
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Chapter's eight to ten contain the reference material describing
    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Qt Designer</I
>'s menus, toolbars, dialogs and key bindings.
