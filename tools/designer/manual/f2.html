>	This manual introduces you to using the Qt Designer, a unique tool
	that makes designing and implementing user interfaces a lot
	easier. You will learn how to create your own dialogs with the Qt
	Designer, how to arrange the user interface elements in the
	dialogs so that the dialog looks both nice and natural and can
	accomodate to various environments like different languages,
different user settings, etc.</P
><P
>This manual consists of two parts. The first one starts with a gentle
tutorial-style introduction to the Qt designer which leads you through
creating some dialogs for a simple application. You will learn how to
use the user interface compiler <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>uic</I
> to create
source code out of the user interface description files that the Qt
Designer saves and how to integrate these files into your
application. Further steps show you how to modify an already existing
dialog, how to use layout management to get more flexible and powerful
dialogs and how to customize dialogs created with the Qt designer by
creating a subclass.
	</P
><P
>The second part of this manual is a reference-style
	description for the Qt designer. Each menu entry and each dialog
	is explained in detail. If you are unsure about what to fill in in
	one of the configuration dialogs of Qt Designer, this is the place
	where to look for help if the online help is not enough.</P

>This manual assumes that you have some knowledge in
	  writing Qt programs and consequently in C++ programming. If you
	  feel unsafe about your Qt knowledge, you might want to consult
	  the Qt Tutorial that ships with Qt or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Programming with
	  Qt</I
> by Matthias Kalle Dalheimer, published by O'Reilly
	  &#38; Associates. Or, you can just try to follow the examples in
	  this manual and read up on any Qt knowledge that you might lack
	  when Qt features turn up that you are uncertain about.</P
