In this chapter we will explain how to create an application's main
window and how to add actions (explained shortly), menus and toolbars.
We will also demonstrate how some common actions, like cut and paste in
a \class[QTextEdit], can be performed automatically simply by making the
appropriate signals and slots connections. We will build the \i[richedit]
application to illustrate the necessary techniques.

We begin by creating a project file. Start \qd or if it is already
running close any existing project and files. Click 
\menu[File|New Project] to invoke the \dlg[Project Settings] dialog. Enter a
name for the project, e.g. richedit, and a name for the  project file,
e.g. richedit.pro. Click \ok. If you're unfamiliar with Actions and
Action Groups the sidebar provides the necessary introduction; otherwise
skip ahead to <xref linkend="designing-the-main-window"> "Designing the
Main Window".

<sidebar>\title[Actions and Action Groups]
<para id="ajpo">
An \i[action] is some operation that the user initiates through the user
interface, for example, saving a file or changing some text's font
weight to bold.
</para>

<para id="ajpu">
We often want the user to be able to perform an action using a variety
of means. For example, to save a file we might want the user to be able
to press <keycap>Ctrl+S</>, or to click the \button[Save] toolbar button
or to click the \menu[File|Save] menu option. Although the means of
invoking the action are all different the underlying operation is the
same and we don't want to duplicate the code that performs the
operation. In Qt we can create an action (a \class[QAction] object)
which will call the appropriate function when the action is invoked. We
can assign an accelerator, (e.g. <keycap>Ctrl+S</>), to an action. We
can also add an action to a menu item and to a toolbar button.
</para>

<para id="ajqh">
If the action has an on/off state, e.g. bold is on or off, when the user
changes the state, for example by clicking a toolbar button, the state
of everything associated with the action, e.g. menu items and toolbar
buttons, are updated. 
</para>

<para id="ajqo">
Some actions should operate together like radio buttons. For example, if
we have left align, center align and right align actions, only one
should be 'on' at any one time. An \i[action group] (a
\class[QActionGroup] object) is used to group a set of actions together.
If the action group's \c[exclusive] property is TRUE then only one of
the actions in the group can be on at any one time. If the user changes
the state of an action in an action group where \c[exclusive] is TRUE,
everything associated with the actions in the action group, e.g. menu
items and toolbar buttons, are updated.
</para>

\x[Actions and Action Groups]
\qd can create actions and action groups visually, can assign
accelerators to them, and can associate them with menu items and toolbar
buttons.

    our own actions, menus and toolbar. We will add some widgets to the
    toolbar and add a main widget to the main window. Finally we will
    connect signals to slots to take advantage of Qt's default
    functionality and minimize our coding.

	functionality was achieved by connecting built-in signals to our
	own custom slots. We could continue developing the application,
	for example updating the fontComboBox, the font size spinbox and
	the actions with the font attributes as the user moves the
	cursor through their text. But our objective has been to
	demonstrate the creation of a main window with actions, menus
	and toolbars so we must stop at this point and leave further
	development and experimentation to you.
