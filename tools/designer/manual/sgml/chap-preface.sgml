    <title>Preface</title>
    <para>
    This manual introduces Qt Designer, a unique tool that makes
    designing and implementing user interfaces much easier. With Qt
    Designer you can create your own dialogs and arrange user
    interface elements in the dialogs. Dialogs will look nice, natural
    and accommodate various environments, such as different languages
    and user settings.
    </para>

    <para>
    The manual is divided into two parts. Part I begins with an
    introduction to Qt Designer and leads to creating dialogs for a
    simple application. It explains how to use the user interface
    compiler, <command>uic</>, to create source code from the user
    interface description files that Qt Designer saves and how to
    integrate these files into an application. It also shows you how
    to modify an already existing dialog, how to use layout management
    to develop more flexible and powerful dialogs, and how to
    customize dialogs created with Qt Designer by creating a subclass.
    </para>

    <para>
    Part II of the manual is a reference-style description of Qt
    Designer. It explains each menu entry and each dialog in detail.
    If you are unsure about what to insert in one of the configuration
    dialogs of Qt Designer and the online help is not enough, this is
    the place to look for help.

<title>What You Should Know</title>

    <para>
    We assume that you have some knowledge of writing Qt programs and,
    consequently, of C++ programming. If you feel unsure about your Qt
    knowledge, you might want to consult the Qt Tutorial that ships
    with Qt, or the book <emphasis>Programming with Qt</> by Matthias
    Kalle Dalheimer (published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates). Or you
    can just try to follow the examples in this manual and then read
    more about any Qt features about which you are uncertain.
    </para>

<title>Feedback</title>

    <para>
    We are very interested in your feedback, whether positive or
    negative. We would like to know if you come across anything in
    this manual that you consider wrong, ill-formulated, or explained
    in too difficult a manner. It is equally helpful for us to hear of
    your satisfaction, suggestions for further editions of both the
    manual and Qt Designer itself, or anything else that you would
    like to comment on in the world of Qt. Bug reports should be sent
    to &lt;<literal>qt-bugs&commat;trolltech.com</>&gt;. Otherwise
    please contact us at
    &lt;<literal>info&commat;trolltech.com</>&gt;.
    </para>

    If you hold a commercial Qt license, you can also use the support
    channels that were assigned to you when you bought your license.
