This small application makes is much easier to create customwidget
descriptions for the Qt Designer. Using them you can use your custom
widget in the Qt Designer with all signals, slots and properties. 

To do that normally you would have to enter all that information in
the custom widget dialog in the Qt Designer for each widget. But this
small tool can create for you these description files for your custom
widgets which you then can simply import into the Qt Designer. So you
can use your custom widgets without any additional work in your froms
on the Qt Designer then.

To do that you have to modify the sourcecode (main.cpp) a bit and
recompile it afterwards. For further instructions how to use it see
the comments starting with STEP1 and STEP2 in main.cpp.
