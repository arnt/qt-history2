qt3to4 - The Qt Porting Tool

This porting tool provides help when moving a project from Qt 3 to Qt 4. It 
is designed to automate all trivial porting tasks.

Usage:
First, make a copy of your project which the porting tool can work on. Then run 
the porting tool on the copy of the project.

qt3to4 has two usage modes:
* File mode:     qt3to4 infile.cpp/h 
* Project mode:  qt3to4 infile.pro   

In file mode a single file will be processed. In project mode the 
.pro file will be parsed and all files specified in it will be processed. 

What it does:
* Renames classes that are now in compat (ex. QFileDialog -> Q3FileDialog)
* Renames  header #include directives to the new Qt 4 style 
  ( #include <QClass> )
* prefixes or renames enum values that have been moved or renamed 
  (ex. QButton::On -> QCheckBox::On)
* misc changes (ex. TRUE -> true )


Logging:
The porting tool logs all changes to a file called "portinglog.txt", placed in 
the directory from wich the porting tool was started. This log will contain
a isting of all changes made to source files.

Rules file:
The Qt porting tool reads porting rules from an xml file named rules.xml, 
located in $QTDIR/tools/porting. It is possible to customize the porting tool
behaviour by editting this file.

Information regarding the beta:
This is a beta version of the port program, it is intended to demonstrate
how the finished program will work. Developers are encoraged to test it on
their projects and report results back to Trolltech.

The following are known issues with this version, and will be adressed in the
next release:

* Handle proper scoping of names. 
  This version of the Qt porting tool might change names witch it shouldn't. For
  example a user-created variable named color0 will be changed to Qt::color0,
  which is probably not the wanted behaviour.

* Qt library split. Since the Qt library has been split into several smaller
  libraries, a QT += <library> line needs to be added to the .pro file depending on witch
  classes are used. Currently only the compat library is added if it's not 
  already in the .pro file.
  
* the rules.xml file will be updated in order to make it as complete as 
  possible.
