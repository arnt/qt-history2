Qt's painting system is able to render vector graphics, images, and outline
font-based text with sub-pixel accuracy accuracy using anti-aliasing to
improve rendering quality.

These examples show the most common techniques that are used when painting
with Qt, from basic concepts such as drawing simple primitives to the use of
transformations.


The example launcher provided with Qt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the "Tutorial and Examples"
link in the main Qt documentation.


Finding the launcher
====================

On Windows:


On Mac OS X:


On Unix/Linux:


On all platforms:

The source code for the launcher can be found in the examples/tools/launcher
directory in the Qt package. This example is built at the same time as the
Qt libraries, tools, examples, and demonstrations.
