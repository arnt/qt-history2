  \title A small client-server example
 
  This example shows how two programs can communicate using sockets. It
  consists out of two different programs: a server and a client.
  
  The server listens on port number 4242 and accepts incoming connections.
  It sends back every line he receives from the client. The line is
  prepended with the line number.

  The client tries to connect to the server on the host specified on the
  command line or to localhost if no command line arguments are
  specified. You can send single lines to the server.
