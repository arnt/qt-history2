All the standard features of application main windows are provided by Qt.

Main windows can have pull down menus, tool bars, and dock windows. These
separate forms of user input are unified in an integrated action system that
also supports keyboard shortcuts and accelerator keys in menu items.


The example launcher provided with Qt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.


Finding the Qt Examples and Demos launcher
==========================================

On Windows:

The launcher can be accessed via the Windows Start menu. Select the menu
entry entitled "Qt Examples and Demos" entry in the submenu containing
the Qt tools.

On Mac OS X:

Type "qtdemo" on the command line or use the "Qt Examples and Demos"
entry on the Start menu to run the launcher.

On Unix/Linux:

The qtdemo executable is installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path
specified when Qt is configured.

On all platforms:

The source code for the launcher can be found in the examples/tools/qtdemo
directory in the Qt package. This example is built at the same time as the
Qt libraries, tools, examples, and demonstrations.
