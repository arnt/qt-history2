  \title Displaying the results of a SQL query 

  This example demonstrates how to display the results of a QSqlQuery
  in a table.

  \quotefile sql/sqlmodel/simple/main.cpp
  \skipto main(
  \printuntil createConnection

  A QApplication object is neccessary in order to use databases.
  \c createConnection() is just a local function that opens a database
  connection for us.

  \printto view

  A QSqlModel is created and its parent is set to the QApplication, making
  sure that it will be deleted when the application exits. Next, a SQL
  query is executed and the QSqlModel is populated with the results of the
  query. If the query fails, the model will be empty and nothing is displayed.

  \printto app.exec

  A QGenericTableView is created and our QSqlModel is set as data model. The parent
  is 0, since the table is our top-level widget.

  \printuntil }

  The application is executed and will display a table with the results
  of the SQL query.
