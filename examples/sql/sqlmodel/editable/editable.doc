  \title  Example for an editable QSqlModel

  This example demonstrates how to create an editable SQL model by 
  subclassing QSqlModel.

  Note that in real life a QSqlTableModel would have been used to make a
  single table editable, this example just shows the principles how to
  subclass QSqlModel if QSqlTableModel is not sufficient enough for your needs.

  \quotefile sql/sqlmodel/editable/main.cpp
  \skipto class EditableSqlModel
  \printuntil };

  In order to make a QSqlModel editable, it is neccessary to reimplement
  \c isEditable() and \c setData(). Nothing is done in the constructor.

  \printuntil }

  The method \c isEditable() indicates whether an item is editable or not.
  In this model, only the third column is editable.
  If the item's type is not \c QModelIndex::View, we let the parent class
  handle the request.

  \printuntil return false

  The same check is done in setData(), we only allow editing of the third column.

  \printuntil int id

  In order to find the value in the database table, we need the primary key, which
  we know is the first column in the current row. The value of the primary key is
  saved in the variable \c id.

  \printuntil }

  Finally, the value is written into the database and the query is executed again
  to reflect the changes to the table. If it was not possible to insert the value,
  false is returned.
  
  \printuntil }

  This is just a convenience method that sets the \c lastname column in the 
  database table to a new value at the specified position.

  Note that the first call to \c setQuery() is a workaround for sqlite since
  sqlite is not capable to modify the table that is currently displayed.
  It is not neccessary for all other database systems.

  \skipto main(
  \printuntil }

  The main function is almost identical to the \link sqlmodel-example.html
  QSqlModel example\endlink. The only difference is that EditableSqlModel is
  used instead of QSqlModel.

  The application will display the database table and the third column will be editable.
