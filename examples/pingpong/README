This example demonstrates how to use some of the classes in the SQL

To be able to run the example application, you will need to connect to
a Postgres v6.x database. You have to modify the main.cpp file, and
replace the database name, user name and password, and the hostname
with your own parameters. The pingpong.sql file contains the SQL
statements that are used to set up the tables in the pingpong
database.
