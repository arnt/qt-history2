	<p><h2>Help example</h2></p>
	
	<p>
	This example demonstrates how to use Qt Assistant as help system
	for your own application. You can control Qt Assistant either directly
	using e.g. the open button or indirectly by pressing F1.
	</p>

	<p>
	This example provides a context sensitive help, i.e. pressing F1 will
	show the help for the item under the mouse cursor.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In order to run Qt Assistant properly you have to install the
	documentation profile for this example. Without the profile Qt
	Assistant will run with the default profile, which contains the
	documentation for Qt. It can still display arbitrary pages with
	the <i>Display</i> button or using the context help (F1), but Qt
	Assistant won't be customized for this example application.
	</p>

	<p>
	Installing the documentation profile for this example is done
	by pressing the 'Install example documentation' button in
	the Help Example application. This will call the function
	<code>HelpDemo::installExampleDocs()</code> in the
	<code>helpdemo.cpp</code> file. This function shows how
	assistant can be run with the <code>-addProfile</code> option
	which will install the profile. If the user then checks the
	<i>Run Qt Assistant customized for HelpExample</i> button, assistant will
	be run with the option <code>-profile HelpExample</code> which
	will tell Qt Assistant to display only the documentation specified
	in that profile and to be customized according to the profile. 
	At the enduser, the installation procedure will most likely
	perform the installing of the profile and the application will
	always call assistant with the <code>-profile</code> option.
