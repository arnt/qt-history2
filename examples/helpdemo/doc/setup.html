	<p><h2>Setup Profile</h2></p>
	<p>The very first time you start Qt Assistant, e.g. to be able to read
	   this help, a default profile containing all Qt related documentation
	   will be created. This means also, that there won't be any documentation
	   available (in the contents, index or search) for this example. The only
	   way to get it displayed is by starting Qt Assistant with the file name
	   as command line option. </p>
	<p>In order to change that, you have to install a profile. You find the
	   profile file (help.adp) in the help directory. The installation itself
	   is straightforward. Quit the example and enter</p>
	<p>assistant helpdemo.adp /path/to/your/qt/examples/help/directory</p>
	<p>Now, Qt Assistant has installed the profile for this help application.
	   If you restart the example and invoke the help, you'll realize that
	   Qt Assistant is adapted for this example, i.e. no Qt related documention
	   will be visible. Also the caption and some icons have been changed.</p>
