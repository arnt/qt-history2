This examples directory contains lots of Qt examples. And there are
additional examples in ../tools/designer/examples/ and in the
extensions subdirectories. The documentation contains two detailed Qt
tutorials and additional tutorials for Qt Designer. The examples here
are useful for learning particular Qt classes and techniques, but to
learn Qt itself we recommend starting with the documentation's short
"How to Learn Qt" document.


aclock
    This example displays an analog clock widget.
    It shows how to create a custom widget (QWidget subclass) and how
    to create a timer using QTimer.

action
    A single document interface application example with a menu bar,
    tool bar and status bar that provides simple text editing.
    It shows how to implement a typical modern application, how to
    create a QMainWindow subclass, and how to create actions that can
    be assigned to menus (QPopupMenu) and toolbars (QToolBar) using
    QAction. It also shows how to print using QSimpleRichText.

addressbook [obsolete]

application [obsolete; see the action example instead]

biff [Unix-specific]
    Biff is a simple graphical program to indicate whether there is
    new mail; it looks like xbiff but is much shorter.

buttongroups
    This examples shows different types of group boxes (QButtonGroup,
    and QGroupBox), and different kinds of buttons (QCheckBox,
    QRadioButton, and QPushButton). It also shows how to add a
    QPopupMenu to a button.

canvas
    This examples demonstrates many of QCanvasView's facilities, but
    by no means all of them. It uses QCanvasItem, QCanvasLine,
    QCanvasRectangle, QCanvasEllipse, QCanvasSprite, and of course
    QCanvas.

chart
    An application for maintaining simple numeric data and visualising
    the data using pie and bar charts.

    kinds of lists are often used with setup programs.)
    Shows the use of QListView, QListViewItem, QCheckListItem,
    QListViewItemIterator, and QValueList.

cursor
    This example shows how to set the mouse cursor for a widget. Shows
    Qt's cursors and a custom cursor using QLabel and QCursor.

    (geometry) manager, like a Card-Layout, Border-Layout and
    Flow-Layout.

dclock
    This example displays a digital LCD clock and can switch between
    time and date.
    It uses the QLCDNumber widget and a couple of QTimers.

demo
    Run this to see almost all of Qt's widgets in action, including
    drag and drop, 2D graphics, etc.

desktop
    The desktop demo contains three routines, each of which draws
    something on the desktop. It does some nice stuff with QPainter,
    and also demonstrates how one can treat the desktop as a widget
    like any other.

directpainter [Qt/Embedded-specific]
    Shows the use of QDirectPainter.

dirview
    This example program demonstrates how to use a QListView and
    QListViewItems to build a multi-column hierarchical, memory- and
    CPU-efficient directory browser. It also demonstrates how to use
    Drag'n'Drop in a QListview. (See also the fileiconview example.)

distributor
    This is a utility program that can be used to modify the paths
    used in the Qt library binary to make the binary suitable for
    distribution. For experts only.

    Draws a color wheel, text and shapes. This example demonstrates
    several drawing functions and printer output using QPainter,
    QWMatrix, QFont, QFontMetrics, QColor, QBrush, and QPrinter. You
    can easily add you own drawing functions. See "ourDrawFunctions".

drawlines

    painting without any world transform matrix or other advanced
    features. Run the program, click the button, move the mouse,
    release the button, and watch the lines get drawn.

extension
    An extension dialog with simple and advanced appearances
    controlled by a toggle button.

fileiconview
    This example partially implements a very basic file manager using
    a widget derived from QIconView to display the current directory.
    It uses the DirectoryView widget from the dirview example to
    display the directory tree.
    It also shows how to add a QComboBox to a QToolBar and how to
    implement a context menu using QPopupMenu.

fonts [obsolete]

forever
    WARNING: this program has a strobe effect.
    See how fast Qt can draw colored rectangles. This example
    continuously draws rectangles in a window and has another widget
    that counts the number of rectangles that are drawn per second.

gridview
    A QGridView with 100x100 cells.

hello
    Hello world with colored animated wavy text.

    various ways in a Qt application using QToolTip, QWhatsThis, and
    QAssistantClient to control Qt Assistant.

helpviewer
    The HelpViewer example implements a simple HTML help browser using
    Qt's richtext capabilities.

  special reasons. It looks and works like the mainwindow of a mail client.

- mdi
  Similar to the application and action examples, but this time using
  MDI (Multiple Document Interface).

  magnify or drag out a rectangle. Two combo boxes let you select
  amplification and refresh frequency, a text label tells you the color
  of the pixel the cursor is on, and a button lets you save the
  magnified area as a .bmp file.

- rot13
  In this example you can enter a text in one Mulitilineedit widget
  and it is displayed in the edit widget at the right transformed using
  the rot13 algorithm.

- scribble
  This example implements the famous scribble example. You can draw
  around in the canvas with different pens and save the result as picture.

- scrollview

  (themes). Example themes looking like wood and metal are
  implemented. You can switch between the different styles at runtime
  using the pulldown menu.

- tictac
  This is an implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game.

  We didn't put much effort in making a clever algorithm so it's not a
  challenge to play against the computer. Instead, study the source code
  to see how you can make reusable components such as the TicTacGameBoard
  widget.

- tooltip
  This example widget demonstrates how to use tool tips for static and
  dynamic regions within a widget.
  It displays two blue and one red rectangle. The blue ones move every
  time you click on them, the red one is static. There are dynamic
  tool tips on the blue rectangles and a static tool tip on the red one.
