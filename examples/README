  multi-columns). It also shows how to subclass Listview Items for
  special reasons. It looks and works like the mainwindow of a mail client.

- mdi
  Similar to the application and action examples, but this time using
  MDI (Multiple Document Interface).

  This example demonstrates simple use of menus (a menu bar and
  pull-down menus). Qt also supports popup menus, but this example

  QLabel classes.

- picture
  This example shows how to make, store to file, and read a picture as

  magnify or drag out a rectangle. Two combo boxes let you select
  amplification and refresh frequency, a text label tells you the color
  of the pixel the cursor is on, and a button lets you save the
  magnified area as a .bmp file.

  (themes). Example themes looking like wood and metal are

  using the pulldown menu.

- tictac
  This is an implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game.

  We didn't put much effort in making a clever algorithm so it's not a
  challenge to play against the computer. Instead, study the source code
  to see how you can make reusable components such as the TicTacGameBoard
  widget.

- tooltip
  This example widget demonstrates how to use tool tips for static and
  dynamic regions within a widget.
  It displays two blue and one red rectangle. The blue ones move every
