This file contains notes on compiling the code for different platforms.

The Makefile contains comments to support many platforms.  You should
modify it to set the parameters for your platform.  Some common problems
people run into are discussed below.

On an SGI IRIX 4, make sure to set the environment variable SGI_IRIX4
to 1, and remove none of the commented out CFLAGS.
