<h1>Rusty's Whipped!</h1>
<strong>by John VanSickle</strong><BR>
<STRONG>ANIMATION DESCRIPTION: </STRONG>
<P>
    Rusty's fast action resolves a potential domestic
dispute.

<P>
OTHER NOTES:  Coming up with the plot for this animation took me longer than
it usually does.  Of course it was going to be a Rusty tale, but the topic
was broad enough that it took me a while to narrow down the possibilities.

<P>
Yes, I am deliberately making fun of any and all entries that show a robot
walking over a checkered plane.  If you are viewing the entries in
alphabetical order, you should already have seen Rosie's entry.  Yes, I did a
walking robot loop animation in my first entry, but at least it wasn't
walking over a checkered plane.

<P>
I did not include the source files because of the recent textbook plagiarism
incident (which you can read about on the povray.general group on the
news.povray.org server).  If you have any questions about how a particular
effect was accomplished, enter a comment (with your e-mail address) and let
me know.
