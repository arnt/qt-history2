<STRONG>DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS ANIMATION WAS CREATED: </STRONG>

<P>
I created the frames using the standard animation support in Strata Studio Pro. 
I used numerous cameras to capture the different clips.  Each object is a shape
that enables easy editing independent of the scene.  The camera that flys
around behind during the pursute phase was achieved by dropping  the path used
by the fly and flybuster adusting it slightly and then linking the the camera
to the same path.  The texures were created in Painter along with the bump
maps.  I used particle affects within StudioPro to attain the engine exhaust
and photon blast.  I changed the color of the glass texture on the eye of the
robot over time to suggest a bit of frustration or anger with the fly.  The
symbols and dirt on the FlyBuster interceptor required the creation of stencil
maps.  I had more neat ideas for this... like having the robot attempt to swat
the fly first, adding sound, but the file size eliminated those possibilites. 
All the frames and text were rendered out in StudioPro.   The movie was
composited in Adobe Premiere, I then used MoviePlayer Pro to compress to MPG
format.
