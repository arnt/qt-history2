<STRONG>ANIMATION DESCRIPTION: </STRONG>
<P>
    The danger of atomic weapons.

<P>
<STRONG>VIEWING RECOMMENDATIONS: </STRONG>
<P>
    I think that the file is
<P>
        too much compresed, but the size is limited, sorry.

<P>
<STRONG>DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS ANIMATION WAS CREATED: </STRONG>

<P>
Problems, problems, problems...The exams did not let me
enough time to do all that I wanted to do, and my
computer did not let me to make the scenes as complex as
I wanted...For example my computer can not play the entire
animation without some jumps in the image. I hope you
can view the animation properly.

<P>
I tried to do by myself all the objects, but finally I
had to get some furniture from "3d cafe".
