WISH LIST
---------
color2 filtering                         [ ]
       "Also, it came to my mind that images made by Color2DitherImage() could
        look much better if the pels where somehow averaged or filtered rather than
        duplicated, as it is the case now."
Add AC-prediction decoding              [ ]
Get dithers to work in VGA mode         [ ] 
IDCT compliance                         [ ]
