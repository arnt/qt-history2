<h1>Revenge</h1>
<strong>by Mike Norton &amp; Willem-Paul van Overbruggen</strong><br>
<STRONG>ANIMATION DESCRIPTION: </STRONG>


<P>
<STRONG>NOTICE</STRONG>
<P>
        This is a parody and is not meant to hurt or offend anyone.  Please
forgive me first if I have upset or angered anyone.

<P>
        "Wow, we knew we made it when Weird Al made a parody of our song!"

<P>
Ok, this animation deals with revenge.  I will not mention any names as you can
figure it out.  I think.  I hope.


<P>
<STRONG>DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS ANIMATION WAS CREATED: </STRONG>


<P>
This animation was done completly in Blender.  No outside software was used,
including the final animation editing.  Blender has a built in sequencer with
fades and plugins.

<P>
The spider was the first object created.  It was fairly simple and was actually
fun.  The hardest part was IKA'ing the spider so it could walk.  

<P>
The set was created and then lit by Willem, the master of lighting.  Man he's
good.  We started trying to use radiosity but the meshes got too large too
fast.  So we went with a lighting mechanism that fakes it out.

<P>
Each scene was placed into its own scene in blender and then set up with the
sequencer to render as one avi.  Then ran it thorough avi2mpg and voila.  Here
it the finished product.
<p>
<STRONG>VIEWING RECOMMENDATIONS: </STRONG>
<P>
    Windows Media Player

I am including the source on my web site at
http://www.jps.net/manorton/blender/revenge.html if you would like to take a
look at it.  You can get Blender at http://www.blender.nl  And for those in the
know, there were no C-Key functions used in this aninmation. It was done
completely with all features in the completely free version.
