<strong>by John VanSickle</strong><br>
<STRONG>DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS ANIMATION WAS CREATED: </STRONG>
<P>
    I took an old model and did the
math to articulate the joints so that they followed the path of the feet.  The
ground uses a normal_map and the repeat warp in order to have the granite
pattern appear to repeat at regular intervals.  I would have used a tiled
floor, but everyone's tired of that, I'm sure, and the surface I used made for
a smaller .MPG file.
