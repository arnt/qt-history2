<h1>Rusty's Late</h1>
<strong>by John VanSickle</strong><BR>
<STRONG>ANIMATION DESCRIPTION: </STRONG>
<P>
    Rusty the Robot is late to his weekly three-way chess
game.

<P>
<STRONG>DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS ANIMATION WAS CREATED: </STRONG>
<P>
    I typed out a bunch of scene<BR>
code with Notepad, and I also used the file writing capabilities of POV 3.1 to
create some mesh files.  The trees, the road, the tractor tread, and the
crystal shell are meshes.  Everything else is CSG.  I didn't include the scene
code because there is over 270K of it.
