The process example does not something particularly useful, but it shows
one typical usage of the class QProcess.

This example starts the uic command with some options and displays the
output of the uic call. The uic is a command line tool that is used if you
create dialogs with the Qt Designer. If you installed Qt correctly, it
should be available on your system. It outputs the generated code to
standard output by default.
