Qt uses a layout-based approach to widget management. Widgets are arranged in
the optimal positions in windows based on simple layout rules, leading to a
consistent look and feel.

Custom layouts can be used to provide more control over the positions and
sizes of child widgets.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the "Tutorial and Examples"
link in the main Qt documentation.
