Here are the programs in the Qt tutorial.  The tutorial itself is in
../doc/html/tutorial.html (or http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/tutorial.html).

All programs corresponding to the chapters in the tutorial should
automatically be built when Qt is compiled, or will be provided as
pre-built executables if you have obtained a binary package of Qt.

If you have only compiled the Qt libraries, use the following instructions
to build the tutorial.

Typing 'make' in this directory builds all the programs (t1/t1,
t2/t2, t3/t3 and so on). Typing 'make' in each subdirectory builds
just that tutorial program.

Feel free to send comments about the tutorial to qt-bugs@trolltech.com.
