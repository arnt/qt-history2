Here are the programs in the Qt tutorial.  The tutorial itself is in
../doc/html/tutorial.html (or http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/tutorial.html).

All programs corresponding to the chapters in the tutorial should
automatically be built when Qt is compiled, or will be provided as
pre-built executables if you have obtained a binary package of Qt.

If you have only compiled the Qt libraries, use the following instructions
to build the tutorial.

On Linux/Unix:

Typing 'make' in this directory builds all the programs (t1/t1,
t2/t2, t3/t3 and so on). Typing 'make' in each subdirectory builds
just that tutorial program.

On Windows:

Create a single Visual Studio project for the tutorial directory in
the usual way. You can do this by typing the following at the command
line:

qmake -tp vc

You should now be able to open the project file in Visual Studio and
build all of the tutorial programs at the same time.

On Mac OS X:

Open each of the .pro files found in the tutorial subdirectories in Xcode
and build them individually.
