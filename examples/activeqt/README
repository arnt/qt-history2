Qt is supplied with a number of example applications and demonstrations that
have been written to provide developers with examples of the Qt API in use,
highlight good programming practise, and showcase features found in each of
Qt's core technologies.

The example and demo launcher can be used to explore the different categories
available. It provides an overview of each example, lets you view the
documentation in Qt Assistant, and is able to launch examples and demos.

Documentation for examples can be found in the Tutorial and Examples section
of the Qt documentation.


Finding the Qt Examples and Demos launcher
==========================================

On Windows:

The launcher can be accessed via the Windows Start menu. Select the menu
entry entitled "Qt Examples and Demos" entry in the submenu containing
the Qt tools.

On Mac OS X:

Type "qtdemo" on the command line or use the "Qt Examples and Demos"
entry on the Start menu to run the launcher.

On Unix/Linux:

The qtdemo executable is installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path
specified when Qt is configured.

On all platforms:

The source code for the launcher can be found in the examples/tools/qtdemo
directory in the Qt package. This example is built at the same time as the
Qt libraries, tools, examples, and demonstrations.
