  \title A Complete Application Window with Actions
 
  This example program is just like the application example,
  but uses QAction to build the menu and the toolbar.

  The QAction related part of the program is covered in
  detail by the <a href="simple-application-action.html">
  QAction application walkthrough</a> whilst the 
  <a href="simple-application.html">Simple application walkthrough</a>
  deals with the rest.
