This example shows how to use the Async Image I/O classes for a simple
animated label. While a similar result can be achieved by using
QLabel::setMovie(), this example is more efficient since it stores
all animation frames and uses the most efficient painting methods.
It also has the advantage that it can function reasonably without
an event loop, thus it can be used for "busy" feedback.
