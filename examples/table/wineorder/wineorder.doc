  \title A wine order list
 
  The following example demonstrates how to use a QTable
  but store the table data in a
  custom data structure instead of using \l{QTableItem}s. 

  This is a very unusual approach and you should think
  carefully about your implementation aims before applying it.
  It is useful if you for example want to use a
  custom database to hold your table data.
 
  The example implements a wine order list 
  where the user can choose the amount of
  bottles via \l{QSpinBox}es.

  The other table cells use QTableItems.
