The table program displays a spreadsheet-like table. It is an example
of how to use QScrollView in combination with QHeader to display 2D
data arrays.

Left-click the mouse and moving the mouse sets a current
cell. Pressing the arrow keys also moves the current mark. Start
typing in text to edit a table cell directly.
