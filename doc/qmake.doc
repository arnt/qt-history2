\title <em>qmake</em>

\e qmake is a simple tool from Trolltech to create and maintain
makefiles for software projects.

It can be a painful task to manage makefiles manually, especially if
you develop for more than one platform or use more than one compiler.
\e qmake automates and streamlines this process and lets you spend
your valuable time on writing code, not makefiles.

The main motivation for developing \e qmake was that we spent far too
much time maintaining makefiles for <a
href="http://www.trolltech.com/qt/">Qt</a>, our cross-platform GUI
toolkit. Qt supports around 15 flavors of Unix, Microsoft Windows, and
around 15 different C++ compilers.  We looked at GNU autoconf, but it
was Unix-specific and not flexible enough in our opinion. Our makefile
system also had to deal with Qt <a
href="http://doc.trolltech.com/metaobjects.html">meta object
compiler</a> (moc) and <a
href="http://doc.trolltech.com/designer/book1.html"> user interface
compiler</a> (uic) issues. The moc program extracts meta information
from C++ files and generates a C++ file with data tables etc, while
the uic program generates additional .h and .cpp files when building a
typical Qt application.  It takes extra work to add makefile rules for
the moc and the uic and we wanted to automate this task.
