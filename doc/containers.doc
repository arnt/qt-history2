    \section1 Introduction

    The Qt library provides a set of general purpose template-based
    container classes. These classes can be used to store items of a
    specified type. For example, if you need a resizable array of
    \l{QString}s, use QVector\<QString\>.

    These container classes are designed to be lighter, safer, and
    easier to use than the STL containers. If you are unfamiliar with
    the STL, or prefer to do things the "Qt way", you can use these
    classes instead of the STL classes.

    The container classes are \l{implicitly shared}, they are
    \l{reentrant}, and they are optimized for speed, low memory
    consumption, and minimal inline code expansion, resulting in
    smaller executables.

    For traversing the items stored in a container, you can use one
    of two types of iterators: \l{Java-style iterators} and
    \l{STL-style iterators}. The Java-style iterators are easier to
    use and provide high-level functionality, whereas the STL-style
    iterators are slightly more efficient and can be used together
    with Qt's and STL's \l{generic algorithms}.

    Qt also offers a \l{foreach} keyword that make it very easy to
    iterate over all the items stored in a container.

    \section1 The Container Classes

    Qt provides the following container classes:

    \table
    \header \i Class \i Summary

    \row \i \l{QList}\<T\>
    \i This is by far the most commonly used container class. It
    stores a list of values of a given type (T) that can be accessed
    by index. Items can be added at either end of the list using
    QList::append() and QList::prepend(), or they can be inserted in
    the middle using QList::insert(). More than any other container
    class, QList is highly optimized to expand to as little code as
    possible in the executable.

    \row \i \l{QLinkedList}\<T\>
    \i This is similar to QList, except that it uses
    iterators rather than integer indexes to access items. It also
    provides better performance than QList when inserting in the
    middle of a huge list, and it has nicer iterator semantics.
    (Iterators pointing to an item in a QLinkedList remain valid as
    long as the item exists, whereas iterators to a QList can become
    invalid after any insertion or removal.)

    \row \i \l{QVector}\<T\>
    \i This stores an array of values of a given type at adjacent
    positions in memory. Inserting at the front or in the middle of
    a vector can be quite slow, because it can lead to large numbers
    of items having to be moved by one position in memory.

    \row \i \l{QStack}\<T\>
    \i This is a convenience subclass of QVector that provides
    "last in, first out" (LIFO) semantics. It adds the following
    functions to those already present in QVector: \link
    QStack::push() push()\endlink, \link QStack::pop() pop()\endlink,
    and \link QStack::top() top()\endlink.

    \row \i \l{QQueue}\<T\>
    \i This is a convenience subclass of QList that provides
    "first in, first out" (FIFO) semantics. It adds the following
    functions to those already present in QList: \link
    QQueue::enqueue() enqueue()\endlink, \link QQueue::dequeue()
    dequeue()\endlink, and \link QQueue::head() head()\endlink.

    \row \i \l{QMap}\<Key, T\>
    \i This provides a dictionary (associative array) that maps keys
    of type Key to values of type T. Normally each key is associated
    with a single value. QMap stores its data in Key order; if order
    doesn't matter QHash is a faster alternative.

    \row \i \l{QMultiMap}\<Key, T\>
    \i This is a convenience subclass of QMap that provides a nice
    interface for multi-valued maps, i.e. maps where one key can be
    associated with multiple values.

    \row \i \l{QHash}\<Key, T\>
    \i This has almost the same API as QMap, but provides
    significantly faster lookups. QHash stores its data in an
    arbitrary order.

    \row \i \l{QMultiHash}\<Key, T\>
    \i This is a convenience subclass of QHash that
    provides a nice interface for multi-valued hashes.

    \endtable

    \keyword {assignable data type}

    The values stored in the various containers can be of any
    \e{assignable data type}. To qualify, a type must provide a
    default constructor, a copy constructor, and an assignment
    operator. This covers most data types you are likely to want to
    store in a container, including basic types such as \c int and \c
    double, pointer types, and Qt data types such as QString, QDate,
    and QTime, but it doesn't cover QObject or any QObject subclass
    (QWidget, QDialog, QTimer, etc.). If you attempt to instantiate a
    QList\<QWidget\>, the compiler will complain that QWidget's copy
    constructor and assignment operators are disabled. If you want to
    store these kinds of objects in a container, store them as
    pointers, for example as QList\<QWidget *\>.

    \keyword {default-constructed values}

    The documentation of certain container class functions refer to
    \e{default-constructed values}; for example, QVector
    automatically initializes its items with default-constructed
    values, and QMap::value() returns a default-constructed value if
    the specified key isn't in the map. For most value types, this
    simply means that a value is created using the default
    constructor (e.g. an empty string for QString). But for built-in
    types like \c{int} and \c{double}, as well as for pointer types,
    the C++ language doesn't specify any initialization; in those
    cases, Qt's containers automatically initialize the value to 0.

    Here's an example custom data type that meets the requirement of
    an assignable data type:

    \code
	class Employee
        {
	public:
	    Employee() {}
            Employee(const Employee &other);

	    Employee &operator=(const Employee &other);

	private:
	    QString myName;
            QDate myDateOfBirth;
	};
    \endcode

    If we don't provide a copy constructor or an assignment operator,
    C++ provides a default implementation that performs a
    member-by-member copy. In the example above, that would have been
    sufficient. Also, if you don't provide any constructors, C++
    provides a default constructor that initializes its member using
    default constructors. Although it doesn't provide any
    explicit constructors or assignment operator, the following data
    type can be stored in a container:

    \code
	struct Movie
        {
	    QString title;
            QDate releaseDate;
        };
    \endcode

    Some containers have additional requirements for the data types
    they can store. For example, the Key type of a QMap\<Key, T\> must
    provide \c operator<(). Such special requirements are documented
    in a class's detailed description. In some cases, specific
    functions have special requirements; these are described on a
    per-function basis. The compiler will always emit an error if a
    requirement isn't met.

    Qt's containers provide operator<<() and operator>>() so that they
    can easily be read and written using a QDataStream. This means
    that the data types stored in the container must also support
    operator<<() and operator>>(). Providing such support is
    straightforward; here's how we could do it for the Movie struct
    above:

    \code
	inline QDataStream &operator<<(QDataStream &out, const Movie &movie)
        {
	    out << (Q_UINT32)movie.id << movie.title
		<< (Q_UINT32)movie.year;
	    return out;
	}

	inline QDataStream &operator>>(QDataStream &in, Movie &movie)
	{
	    Q_UINT32 id, year;
	    in >> id >> movie.title >> year;
            movie.id = (int)id;
            movie.year = (int)year;
	    return in;
        }
    \endcode

    \section1 The Iterator Classes

    Iterators provide a uniform means to access items in a container.
    Qt's container classes provide two types of iterators: Java-style
    iterators and STL-style iterators.

    \section2 Java-Style Iterators

    The Java-style iterators are new in Qt 4.0 and are the standard
    ones used in Qt applications. They are more convenient to use than
    the STL-style iterators, at the price of being slightly less
    efficient. Their API is modelled on Java's iterator classes.

    For each container class, there are two Java-style iterator data
    types: one that provides read-only access and one that provides
    read-write access.

    \table
    \header \i Containers                             \i Read-only iterator
						      \i Read-write iterator
    \row    \i QList\<T\>, QQueue\<T\>                \i QListIterator\<T\>
						      \i QListMutableIterator\<T\>
    \row    \i QLinkedList\<T\>                       \i QLinkedListIterator\<T\>
						      \i QLinkedListMutableIterator\<T\>
    \row    \i QVector\<T\>, QStack\<T\>              \i QVectorIterator\<T\>
						      \i QVectorMutableIterator\<T\>
    \row    \i QMap\<Key, T\>, QMultiMap\<Key, T\>    \i QMapIterator\<Key, T\>
						      \i QMapMutableIterator\<Key, T\>
    \row    \i QHash\<Key, T\>, QMultiHash\<Key, T\>  \i QHashIterator\<Key, T\>
						      \i QHashMutableIterator\<Key, T\>
    \endtable

    In this discussion, we will concentrate on QList and QMap. The
    iterator types for QLinkedList and QVector have exactly the same
    interface as QList's iterators; similarly, the iterator types for
    QHash have the same interface as QMap's iterators.

    Unlike STL-style iterators (covered \link {STL-style iterators}
    below \endlink), Java-style iterators point \e between items
    rather than directly \e at items. For this reason, they are either
    pointing to the very beginning of the container (before the first
    item), at the very end of the container (after the last item), or
    between two items. The diagram below shows the valid iterator
    positions as red arrows for a list containing four items:

    \img javaiterators1.png

    Here's a typical loop for iterating through all the elements of a
    QList\<QString\> in order and printing them to the console:

    \code
	QList<QString> list;
        list << "A" << "B" << "C" << "D";

	QListIterator<QString> i(list);
        while (i.hasNext())
	    cout << i.next().ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    It works as follows: The QList to iterate over is passed to the
    QListIterator constructor. At that point, the iterator is located
    just in front of the first item in the list (before item "A").
    Then we call \link QListIterator::hasNext() hasNext() \endlink to
    check whether there is an item after the iterator. If there is, we
    call \link QListIterator::next() next() \endlink to jump over that
    item. The next() function returns the item that it jumps over. For
    a QList\<QString\>, that item is of type QString.

    Here's how to iterate backward in a QList:

    \code
	QListIterator<QString> i(list);
        i.toBack();
        while (i.hasPrev())
	    cout << i.prev().ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    The code is symmetric with iterating forward, except that we
    start by calling \link QListIterator::toBack() toBack() \endlink
    to move the iterator after the last item in the list.

    The diagram below illustrates the effect of calling
    \link QListIterator::next() next() \endlink and
    \link QListIterator::prev() prev() \endlink on an iterator:

    \img javaiterators2.png

    The following table summarizes the QListIterator API:

    \table
    \header \i Function \i Behavior
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::toFront() toFront() \endlink
	    \i Moves the iterator to the front of the list (before the first item)
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::toBack() toBack() \endlink
	    \i Moves the iterator to the back of the list (after the last item)
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::hasNext() hasNext() \endlink
	    \i Returns true if the iterator isn't at the back of the list
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::next() next() \endlink
	    \i Returns the next item and advances the iterator by one position
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::peekNext() peekNext() \endlink
	    \i Returns the next item without moving the iterator
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::hasPrev() hasPrev() \endlink
	    \i Returns true if the iterator isn't at the front of the list
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::prev() prev() \endlink
	    \i Returns the previous item and moves the iterator back by one position
    \row    \i \link QListIterator::peekPrev() peekPrev() \endlink
	    \i Returns the previous item without moving the iterator
    \endtable

    QListIterator provides no functions to insert or remove items
    from the list as we iterate. To accomplish this, you must use
    QListMutableIterator. Here's an example where we remove all
    odd numbers from a QList\<int\> using QListMutableIterator:

    \code
	QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);
        while (i.hasNext()) {
	    if (i.next() % 2 != 0)
		i.remove();
        }
    \endcode

    The next() call in the loop is made every time. It jumps over the
    next item in the list. The \link QListIterator::remove() remove()
    \endlink function removes the last item that we jumped over from
    the list. The call to \link QListIterator::remove() remove()
    \endlink does not invalidate the iterator, so it is safe to
    continue using it. This works just as well when iterating
    backward:

    \code
	QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);
        i.toBack();
        while (i.hasPrev()) {
	    if (i.prev() % 2 != 0)
		i.remove();
        }
    \endcode

    If want just want to modify the value of an existing item, we can
    use \link QListIterator::setValue() setValue() \endlink. In the
    code below, we replace any value larger than 128 with 128:

    \code
	QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);
        while (i.hasNext()) {
	    if (i.next() > 128)
		i.setValue(128);
        }
    \endcode

    Just like \link QListIterator::remove() remove() \endlink, \link
    QListIterator::setValue() setValue() \endlink operates on the
    last item that we jumped over. If we iterate forward, this is the
    item just before the iterator; if we iterate backward, this is
    the item just after the iterator.

    The \link QListIterator::next() next() \endlink function returns a
    non-const reference to the item in the list. For simple operations,
    we don't even need \link QListIterator::setValue() setValue() \endlink:

    \code
	QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);
        while (i.hasNext())
	    i.next() *= 2;
    \endcode

    As mentioned above, QLinkedList's and QVector's iterator classes
    have exactly the same API as QList. We will now turn to
    QMapIterator, which is somewhat different because it iterates on
    (key, value) pairs.

    Like QListIterator, QMapIterator provides \link
    QMapIterator::toFront() toFront() \endlink, \link
    QMapIterator::toBack() toBack() \endlink, \link
    QMapIterator::hasNext() hasNext() \endlink, \link
    QMapIterator::next() next() \endlink, \link
    QMapIterator::peekNext() peekNext() \endlink, \link
    QMapIterator::hasPrev() hasPrev() \endlink, \link
    QMapIterator::prev() prev() \endlink, \link
    QMapIterator::peekPrev() peekPrev() \endlink, and \link
    QMapIterator::remove() peekPrev() \endlink. The key and value
    components are extracted by calling key() and value() on the
    object returned by next(), peekNext(), prev(), or peekPrev().

    The following example removes all (capital, country) pairs where
    the capital's name ends with "City":

    \code
	QMap<QString, QString> map;
        map.insert("Paris", "France");
        map.insert("Guatemala City", "Guatemala");
        map.insert("Mexico City", "Mexico");
        map.insert("Moscow", "Russia");
        ...

	QMapMutableIterator<QString, QString> i(map);
        while (i.hasNext()) {
	    if (i.next().key().endsWith("City"))
		i.remove();
	}
    \endcode

    QMapIterator also provides a key() and a value() function that
    operate directly on the iterator and that return the key and
    value of the last item that the iterator jumped above. For
    example, the following code copies the contents of a QMap into a
    QHash:

    \code
	QMap<int, QWidget *> map;
        QHash<int, QWidget *> hash;

	QMapIterator<int, QWidget *> i(map);
        while (i.hasNext()) {
	    i.next();
            hash.insert(i.key(), i.value());
        }
    \endcode

    If we want to iterate through all the items with the same
    value, we can use \link QMapIterator::findNext() findNext()
    \endlink or \link QMapIterator::findPrev() findPrev() \endlink.
    Here's an example where we remove all the items with a particular
    value:

    \code
	QMapMutableIterator<int, QWidget *> i(map);
        while (i.findNext(widget))
	    i.remove();
    \endcode

    Similarly, the \link QMapIterator::findNextKey() findNextKey()
    \endlink or \link QMapIterator::findPrevKey() findPrevKey()
    \endlink functions allow us to iterate through all the items with
    the same key (for example, in a multi-map):

    \code
	QMapMutableIterator<int, QWidget *> i(multimap);
        while (i.findNextKey(-1))
	    i.remove();
    \endcode

    \section2 STL-Style Iterators

    STL-style iterators have been available since the release of Qt
    2.0. They are compatible with Qt's and STL's \l{generic
    algorithms} and are optimized for speed.

    For each container class, there are two STL-style iterator types:
    one that provides read-only access and one that provides
    read-write access. Read-only iterators should be used wherever
    possible because they are faster than read-write iterators.

    \table
    \header \i Containers                             \i Read-only iterator
						      \i Read-write iterator
    \row    \i QList\<T\>, QQueue\<T\>                \i QList\<T\>::const_iterator
						      \i QList\<T\>::iterator
    \row    \i QLinkedList\<T\>                       \i QLinkedList\<T\>::const_iterator
						      \i QLinkedList\<T\>::iterator
    \row    \i QVector\<T\>, QStack\<T\>              \i QVector\<T\>::const_iterator
						      \i QVector\<T\>::iterator
    \row    \i QMap\<Key, T\>, QMultiMap\<Key, T\>    \i QMap\<Key, T\>::const_iterator
						      \i QMap\<Key, T\>::iterator
    \row    \i QHash\<Key, T\>, QMultiHash\<Key, T\>  \i QHash\<Key, T\>::const_iterator
						      \i QHash\<Key, T\>::iterator
    \endtable

    The API of the STL iterators is modelled on pointers in an array.
    For example, the ++ operator advances the iterator to the next
    item, and the * operator returns the item that the iterator
    points to. In fact, for QVector and QStack, which store their
    items at adjacent memory positions, the \link QVector::iterator
    iterator \endlink type is just a typedef for T *, and the \link
    QVector::iterator const_iterator \endlink type is just a typedef
    for const T *.

    In this discussion, we will concentrate on QList and QMap. The
    iterator types for QLinkedList and QVector have exactly the same
    interface as QList's iterators; similarly, the iterator types for
    QHash have the same interface as QMap's iterators.

    Here's a typical loop for iterating through all the elements of a
    QList\<QString\> in order and converting them to lower-case:

    \code
	QList<QString> list;
        list << "A" << "B" << "C" << "D";

	QList<QString>::iterator i;
        for (i = list.begin(); i != list.end(); ++i)
	    *i = (*i).toLower();
    \endcode

    Unlike Java-style iterators (covered \link {Java-style iterators}
    above \endlink), STL-style iterators point directly at items. The
    begin() function of a container returns an iterator that points
    to the first item in the container. The end() function of a
    container returns an iterator to the imaginary item one position
    past the last item in the container. end() marks an invalid
    position; it must never be dereferenced. It is typically used in
    a loop's break condition. If the list is empty, begin() equals
    end(), so we never execute the loop.

    The diagram below shows the valid iterator positions as red
    arrows for a vector containing four items:

    \img stliterators1.png

    Iterating backward with an STL-style iterator requires us to
    decrement the iterator \e before we access the item. This
    requires a \c while loop:

    \code
	QList<QString> list;
        list << "A" << "B" << "C" << "D";

	QList<QString>::iterator i = list.end();
        while (i != list.begin()) {
	    --i;
	    *i = (*i).toLower();
	}
    \endcode

    In the code snippets so far, we used the unary \c * operator to
    retrieve the item (of type QString) stored at a certain iterator
    position, and we then called QString::toLower() on it. Most C++
    compilers also allow us to write \c{i->toLower()}, but some
    don't.

    For read-only access, you can use const_iterator, constBegin(),
    and constEnd(). For example:

    \code
	QList<QString>::const_iterator i;
        for (i = list.constBegin(); i != list.constEnd(); ++i)
	    cout << (*i).ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    The following table summarizes the STL-style iterators' API:

    \table
    \header \i Expression \i Behavior
    \row    \i \c{*i}     \i Returns the current item
    \row    \i \c{++i}    \i Advances the iterator to the next item
    \row    \i \c{i += n} \i Advances the iterator by \c n items
    \row    \i \c{--i}    \i Moves the iterator back by one item
    \row    \i \c{i -= n} \i Moves the iterator back by \c n items
    \row    \i \c{i - j}  \i Returns the number of items between iterators \c i and \c j
    \endtable

    The \c{++} and \c{--} operators are available both as prefix
    (\c{++i}, \c{--i}) and postfix (\c{i++}, \c{i--}) operators. The
    prefix versions modify the iterators and return a reference to
    the modified iterator; the postfix versions take a copy of the
    iterator before they modify it, and return that copy. In
    expressions where the return value is ignored, we recommend that
    you use the prefix operators (\c{++i}, \c{--i}), as these are
    slightly faster.

    For non-const iterator types, the return value of the unary \c{*}
    operator can be used on the left side of the assignment operator.

    For QMap and QHash, the \c{*} operator returns the value
    component of an item. If you want to retrieve the key, call key()
    on the iterator. For symmetry, the iterator types also provide a
    value() function to retrieve the value. For example, here's how
    we would print all items in a QMap to the console:

    \code
	QMap<int, int> map;
        ...
        QMap<int, int>::const_iterator i;
        for (i = map.constBegin(); i != map.constEnd(); ++i)
	    cout << i.key() << ": " << i.value() << endl;
    \endcode

    \target foreach
    \section1 The foreach Keyword

    If you just want to iterate over all the items in a container
    in order, you can use Qt's \c foreach keyword. The keyword is a
    Qt-specific addition to the C++ language, and is implemented
    using the preprocessor.

    Its syntax is: \c foreach (\e variable, \e container) \e
    statement. For example, here's how to use \c foreach to iterate
    over a QLinkedList\<QString\>:

    \code
	QLinkedList<QString> list;
        ...
	QString str;
	foreach (str, list)
	    cout << str.ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    The \c foreach code is significantly shorter than the equivalent
    code that uses iterators:

    \code
	QLinkedList<QString> list;
        ...
        QLinkedListIterator<QString> i(list);
        while (i.hasNext())
	    cout << i.next().ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    Just like C++'s \c for loop, the variable used for iteration
    can be defined within the \c foreach statement:

    \code
	QLinkedList<QString> list;
        ...
	foreach (QString str, list)
	    cout << str.ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    And like any other C++ loop construct, you can use braces
    around the body of a \c foreach loop:

    \code
	QLinkedList<QString> list;
        ...
	foreach (QString str, list) {
	    if (str.isEmpty())
		break;
	    cout << str.ascii() << endl;
        }
    \endcode

    With QMap and QHash, \c foreach accesses the value component of
    the (key, value) pairs. If you want to iterate over both the keys
    and the values, you can either use iterators, or you can write
    code like this:

    \code
	QMap<QString, int> map;
        ...
        foreach (QString str, map.keys())
	    cout << str.ascii() << ": " << map.value(str) << endl;
    \endcode

    For a multi-valued map:

    \code
	QMultiMap<QString, int> map;
        ...
        foreach (QString str, map.keys())
	    foreach (int i, map.values(str))
		cout << str.ascii() << ": " << i << endl;
    \endcode

    Qt automatically takes a copy of the container when it enters a
    \c foreach loop. If you modify the container as you are
    iterating, that won't affect the loop. (If you don't modify the
    container, the copy still takes place, but thanks to \l{implicit
    sharing} copying a container is very fast.)

    To be able to use \c foreach in your application, you must define
    the \c QT_KEYWORDS preprocessor symbol. If you use qmake to build
    your application, simply add the following line to your .pro
    file:

    \code
	DEFINES += QT_KEYWORDS
    \endcode

    Without the \c QT_KEYWORDS symbol defined, \c foreach is
    accessible under the name \c Q_FOREACH.

    In addition to \c foreach, the \c QT_KEYWORDS symbol also defines
    a \c forever pseudo-keyword for infinite loops:

    \code
	forever {
	    ...
        }
    \endcode

    \section1 Performance Terminology

    The containers documentation provides information about how fast
    (or slow) each function is as the number of items in the
    container grow. For example, inserting an item in the middle of a
    QLinkedList is an extremely fast operation, irrespective of the
    number of items stored in the QLinkedList. On the other hand,
    inserting an item in the middle of a QVector is potentially very
    expensive if the QVector contains many items, since half of the
    items must be moved one position in memory.

    In the documentation, we use the following terminology, based on
    the \link somewhere "big Oh" notation \endlink:

    \list
    \i \e{constant time}: O(1). A function is said to run in constant
       time if it requires the same amount of time no matter how many
       items are present in the container. One example is
       QLinkedList::insert().

    \i \e{logarithmic time}: O(log \e n). A function that runs in
       logarithmic time is a function whose running time is
       proportional to the logarithm of the number of items in the
       container. One example is qBinaryFind().

    \i \e{linear time}: O(\e n). A function that runs in linear time
       will execute in a time directly proportional to the number of
       items stored in the container. One example is
       QVector::insert().

    \i \e{linear-logarithmic time}: O(\e{n} log \e n). A function
       that runs in linear-logarithmic time is asymptotically slower
       than a linear-time function, but faster than a quadratic-time
       function.

    \i \e{quadratic time}: O(\e{n}^2). A quadratic-time function
       executes in a time that is proportional to the square of the
       number of items stored in the container.
    \endlist

    \section1 Other Container-Like Classes

    Qt includes three template classes that resemble containers in
    some respects. These classes don't provide iterators and cannot
    be used with the \c foreach keyword.

    \list
    \i QVarLengthArray\<T, Prealloc\> provides a low-level
       variable-length array. It can be used instead of QVector in
       places where speed is particularly important.

    \i QCache\<Key, T\> provides a cache to store objects of a certain
       type T associated with keys of type Key.

    \i QPair\<T1, T2\> stores a pair of elements.
    \endlist

    Additional non-template types that compete with Qt's template
    containers are QBitArray, QByteArray, QString, and QStringList.
