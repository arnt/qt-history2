<h1 align=center> Qt Font Matching </h1>

<p>

The QFont class is an abstract specification of an ideal font. This
font must be matched to fit an actual window system font when drawing
is to be done. This is not a trivial operation since there are no
fonts that we can be sure will be available on all window systems at all
times, or even on a single window system at all times. Qt queries the
window system for available fonts and uses a font matching algorithm to
decide which one of the available fonts closely matches the QFont settings.

<p>

In this version Qt has a single built-in font matching mechanism. In
general it is difficult to make a matching algorithm that fits the
needs of all types of applications and we will put in the possibility
for users to supply their own font matching algorithm before the 1.0
release. We believe that the algorithm selected will fit the needs of
all but the most highly specialized feinschmecker word processing
applications.

<p>

The current matching algorithm works as follows:

<p>

First an available font family is found. If the requested is not
available the \link QFont::setStyleHint() style hint \endlink is
used to select a replacement family. If the style hint has not been
set, "helvetica" will be used (this is not optimal and a table of
common font types will be added to Qt before the 1.0 release).

<p>

If even the replacement family is not found, "helvetica" is searched
for, if that too is not found Qt will search for a last resort font,
i.e.  a specific font to match to, ignoring the attribute settings.
Qt searches through a built-in list of very common fonts. If none of
these are available, Qt chickens out, gives you an error message and
aborts (of course this only happens if you are using fonts and Qt \e
has to load a font). We have not been able to find a case where this
happens. Please <a href="mailto:qt-bugs@troll.no">mail us</a> if you
do, preferably with a list of the fonts you have installed (under X
windows, type "xlsfonts").

<p>

The following attributes are then matched, in order of priority:

<ol>
<li> \link QFont::setCharSet() character set \endlink
<li> \link QFont::setFixedPitch() pitch \endlink
<li> \link QFont::setPointSize() point size \endlink
<li> \link QFont::setWeight() weight \endlink
<li> \link QFont::setItalic() italic \endlink
</ol>

<p>

If, for example, a font with the correct character set is found, but
with all other attributes in the list unmatched, it will be chosen before
a font with the wrong character set but with all other attributes correct.

<p>

The point size is defined to match if it is within 20% of the requested
point size. Of course, when several fonts match and only point size
differs the closest point size to the one requested will be chosen.

<p>

Currently using the correct font family has higher priority than
using the correct character set. We are not certain if this should
be reversed and might do so in the 1.0 release. If you have opinions
about this please <a href="mailto:qt-bugs@troll.no">mail us</a>!
