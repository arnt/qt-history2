/*! \example aclock/aclock.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Analog Clock</h1>

  This example displays an analog clock widget.

  Here is the definition:
  <hr>

  \include aclock/aclock.h

  <hr>

  Here is the implementation:

/*! \example connect/connect.cpp

  <h1 align=center>A Graphical Hello World</h1>

  This example shows very simple mouse-based user interaction and
  painting without any world transform matrix or other advanced
  features.  Run the program, click the button, move the mouse,
  release the button, and watch the lines get drawn.
*/


/*! \example cursor/cursor.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Cursors</h1>

  This example shows how to set a mouse cursor for a widget.
*/


/*! \example dclock/dclock.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Digital Clock</h1>

  This example displays a digital LCD clock and can switch between time
  and date.

  Here is the definition:

  \include dclock/dclock.h

  Here is the implementation:
*/


/*! \example drawdemo/drawdemo.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Draw Demo</h1>

  This example demontrates several drawing functions and printer output.
  You can easily add you own drawing functions.  See "ourDrawFunctions".
*/


/*! \example forever/forever.cpp

  <h1 align=center>A Rectangle Draw "Benchmark"</h1>

  This example continuously draws rectangles in a window and
  has another widget that counts the number of rectangles that
  are drawn per second.
*/


/*! \example hello/hello.cpp
  <h1 align=center>Hello, World</h1>

  This example brings up a message box with a text and a button.
*/


/*! \example menu/menu.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Using menus</h1>

  This example demontrates simple use of menus.
*/


/*! \example picture/makepic.cpp
  <h1 align=center>Make Picture</h1>

  This example draws a car in a picture and writes it to a file.
*/


/*! \example picture/showpic.cpp
  <h1 align=center>Show Picture</h1>

  This example loads a picture file and displays it in a window.
*/


/*! \example qmag/qmag.cpp

<h1 align=center>QMag</h1>

This is a simple magnifier-type program.  It shows how one can do
some quite low-level operations portably using Qt.

<p>

Run it, click in the magnifier window, then click where you want to
magnify.  Two combo boxes let you select amplification and refresh
frequency, and a text label tells you the color of the pixel the
cursor is on.
*/


/*! \example showimg/showimg.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Show Image</h1>

  This example reads and displays an image.
*/


/*! \example tictac/tictac.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Tic Tac Toe</h1>

  This is an implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game.

  We didn't put much effort in making a clever algorithm so it's not a
  challenge to play against the computer. Instead, study the source code
  to see how you can make reusable components such as the TicTacGameBoard
  widget.

  Here is the definition of the tic-tac-toe classes:
  <hr>

  \include tictac/tictac.h

  <hr>

  Here is the implementation:
*/


/*! \example widgets/widgets.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Widgets Demo</h1>

  This example creates a window with many Qt widgets and two custom
  example widgets; aclock and dclock.

  It also shows how to connect widget signals to internal slots.
*/


/*! \example xshape/xshape.cpp

  <h1 align=center>X Shape Extension Demo</h1>

  This example creates a window which make use of the X Shape Extension.
