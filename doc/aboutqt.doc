\title About Qt

Qt is a multiplatform C++ GUI toolkit created and maintained by\link
troll.html Trolltech\endlink. It provides application developers with
all the functionality needed to build applications with
state-of-the-art graphical user interfaces. Qt is fully
object-oriented, easily extensible, and allows true component
programming. Read the \link

Since its commercial introduction in early 1996, Qt has formed the
basis of many thousands of successful applications worldwide. Qt is
also the basis of the popular \link http://www.kde.org/ KDE \endlink
