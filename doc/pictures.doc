\title Pictures of Most Qt Widgets

Most of these widgets are pictured in either Motif or Windows style. 
All widgets are supported in both styles (plus other \link QStyle
styles\endlink), but for clarity we've chosen to cut down on the
number of repeated images.

Here you see three views seperated by \l {QSplitter}s. At the
top-left you see a \l QListBox, at the top-right you see a \l
QListView with a \l QHeader and two \l {QScrollBar}s. And at the
bottom you see a \l QIconView.

\caption Windows

In this screenshot you see a \l QMainWindow which contains on the top
a \l QMenuBar, below that and at the left some \l {QToolBar}s with
widgets like \l {QToolButton}s and \l {QComboBox}es. The central
widget is a \l QWorkspace which is used for MDI window management and
which contains as MDI-Window a \l QMultiLineEdit here. At the bottom
you see a \l QStatusBar and at the right/bottom edge a \l QSizeGrip.

\caption Windows

Here you see a \l QFileDialog. On the Windows Platform you can either
use the QFileDialog or the native Windows file dialog. This is
explained in the \l QFileDialog class documentation.

\caption Windows

This is a QPrintDialog. On Windows this dialog is not supported, as the
native Windows Print-Dialog is used there. Use QPrinter::setup() for
portability instead of the QPrintDialog if you need to be platform
independent.

\caption Motif

In this screenshot you see a \l QFontDialog.

And in this picture a \l QColorDialog is shown.

For displaying messages you will use
the \l QMessageBox.

\img qmsgbox-w.png
\caption Windows

This image shows a \l QProgressDialog. The \l QProgressBar can also
be used as a separate widget.

\img qprogdlg-w.png
\caption Windows

In the screenshot below you see a \l QGroupBox that contains a \l
QLineEdit, a read-only \l QComboBox and an editable \l QComboBox.

\img groupbox-w.png
\caption Windows

This screenshot shows a \l QPopupMenu.

\img qpopmenu-w.png
\caption Windows

In the screenshot below you see a \l QButtonGroup containing four \l
{QRadioButton}s and two \l {QCheckBox}es.

\img buttongroup-w.png
\caption Windows

All views in the first screenshot are widgets derived from a \l
QScrollView. But this class can also manage lots of child-widgets,
like in this screenshot.

\img qscrollview-m.png
\caption Motif

This screenshot shows a \l QTabDialog. The tabs (\l QTabBar) or the
more convenient class \l QTabWidget, which combines a tab bar with
the pages, can be used separately. In the visible page you see a \l
QLabel, the range controls \l QSlider and \l QSpinBox and below a \l
QLCDNumber. In the bottom row you can see some \l {QPushButton}s.

\img qtabdlg-w.png
\caption Windows

In this screenshot you see the \l QTextBrowser displaying a HTML
page. See also \l QTextEdit.
