\title Setting the Application Icon

The application icon, typically displayed in the top-left corner of an
application's top-level windows, is set by calling the
QWidget::setIcon() method on top-level widgets.

In order to change the icon of the executable application file
itself, as it is presented on the desktop (i.e. prior to application
execution), it is necessary to employ another, platform-dependent
technique.

\section1 Setting the Application Icon on Windows

First, create an ICO format bitmap file that contains the icon image. This
can be done with e.g. Microsoft Visual C++: Select "File|New...", then
select the "File" tab in the dialog that appears, and choose "Icon". (Note
that you do not need to load your application into Visual C++; here we are
only using the icon editor).

Store the ICO file in your application's source code directory, for
example, with the name, "myappico.ico". Then, create a text file
called e.g. "myapp.rc" in which you put a single line of text:
\code
IDI_ICON1               ICON    DISCARDABLE     "myappico.ico"
\endcode

Finally, assuming you are using \link qmake-manual.book qmake\endlink
to generate your makefiles, add this line to your "myapp.pro" file:

\code
RC_FILE = myapp.rc
\endcode

Regenerate your makefile and your application. The .exe file will now be
represented with your icon e.g. in Explorer.

If you do not use \link qmake-manual.book qmake\endlink, the necessary
steps are: first, run the "rc" program on the .rc file, then link your
application with the resulting .res file.

\section1 Setting the Application Icon on Mac OS X

The application icon, typically displayed in the application dock
area, is set by calling QWidget::setIcon() on a top-level widget. It
is possible that the program could appear in the application dock area
before the function call, in which case a default icon will appear
during the bouncing animation. 

To ensure that the correct icon appears, both when the application is
being launched, and in the Finder, it is necessary to employ a
platform-dependent technique.

Although many programs can create icon files (\c .icns), the recommended
approach is to use the \e{Icon Composer} program supplied by Apple (in the
Developer/Application folder). \e{Icon Composer} allows you to import several
different sized icons (for use in different contexts) as well as the masks
that go with them. Save the set of icons to a file in your project
directory.

If you are using \link qmake-manual.book qmake\endlink to generate
your make files, you only need to add a single line to your \c .pro
project file. For example, if the name of your icon file is
\c{myapp.icns}, and your project file is \c{myapp.pro}, add this line
to \c{myapp.pro}:
\code
RC_FILE = myapp.icns
\endcode
This will ensure that \link qmake-manual.book qmake\endlink puts your
icons in the proper place and creates an \c{Info.plist} entry for the
icon.

If you do not use \link qmake-manual.book qmake\endlink, you must do
the following manually:
\list 1
\i Create an Info.plist file for your application (using the
PropertyListEditor, found in Developer/Applications).
\i Associate your .icns record with the CFBundleIconFile record in the
Info.plist file (again, using the PropertyListEditor).
\i Copy both the icns and your Info.plist into your application bundle
Resource directory.
\endlist
