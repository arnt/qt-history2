  \class QQueue qqueue.h
  \brief The QQueue class is a template class that provides a queue.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  QQueue is implemented as a template class. A template instance
  QQueue\<X\> is a queue that operates on pointers to X.

  A queue is a first in, first out structure. Items are added to the
  tail of the queue with enqueue() and retrieved from the head with
  dequeue(). You can peek at the head item without dequeing it using
  head().

  QQueue also has some functions for compatibility with the other
  collection classes, such as isEmpty(), count(), clear(), current(),
  and remove(). current() and remove() both operate on the head().

  \sa collection classes
*/

/*! \fn QQueue::QQueue ()
  Creates an empty queue with autoDelete() set to FALSE.
*/

/*! \fn QQueue::QQueue (const QQueue<type>& queue)
  Creates a queue from another.

  Only the pointers are copied - the items are not.  The autoDelete()
  flag is set to FALSE.
*/

/*! \fn QQueue::~QQueue ()

  Destroys the queue.  Items in the queue are deleted if autoDelete()
  is TRUE.
*/

/*! \fn QQueue<type>& QQueue::operator= (const QQueue<type>& queue)

  Assigns \a queue to this queue and returns a reference to this
  queue.

  This queue is first cleared and then each item in \a queue is
  enqueued to this queue.  Only the pointers are copied.

  Note that the autoDelete() flag is not modified. If it it TRUE for
  both \a queue and this queue, deleting the two lists cause
  double-deletion of the items.
*/

/*! \fn bool QQueue::isEmpty () const

  Returns TRUE if the queue is empty and FALSE if there is at least
  one item enqueued.

  \sa count() dequeue() head()
*/

/*! \fn void QQueue::enqueue (const type* d)

  Adds \a d to the tail of the queue.

  \sa count() dequeue()
*/

/*! \fn type* QQueue::dequeue ()

  Takes the head item from the queue and returns a pointer to it.

  \sa enqueue() count()
*/

/*! \fn bool QQueue::remove ()

  Removes the head item from the queue, and returns TRUE if there was
  an item or FALSE if the queue was empty.

  The item is deleted if autoDelete() is TRUE.

  \sa head() isEmpty() dequeue()
*/

/*! \fn void QQueue::clear()

  Removes all items from the queue, and deletes them if autoDelete()
  is TRUE.

  \sa remove()
*/

/*! \fn uint QQueue::count() const

  Returns the number of items in the queue.

  \sa isEmpty()
*/

/*! \fn type* QQueue::head () const

  Returns a reference to the head item in the queue.  The queue is
  not changed.

  \sa dequeue() isEmpty()
*/

/*! \fn QQueue::operator type* ()const

  Returns a reference to the head item in the queue.  The queue is
  not changed.

  \sa dequeue() isEmpty()
*/

/*! \fn type* QQueue::current () const

  Returns a reference to the head item in the queue.  The queue is
  not changed.

  \sa dequeue() isEmpty()
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QQueue::autoDelete() const
  
  Returns the setting of the auto-delete option. The default is FALSE.

  \sa setAutoDelete()
*/

/*!
  \fn void QQueue::setAutoDelete( bool enable )

  Sets the queue to auto-delete its contents if \a enable is TRUE and
  to never delete them if \a enable is FALSE.

  If auto-deleting is turned on, all the items in a queue are deleted
  when the queue itself is deleted. This can be quite convenient if
  the queue has the only pointer to the items.
  
  The default setting is FALSE, for safety. If you turn it on, be
  careful about copying the queue - you might find yourself with two
  queues deleting the same items.

  \sa autoDelete()
