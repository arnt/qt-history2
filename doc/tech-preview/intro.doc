    \title Welcome to the Qt 4 Technology Preview

Dear Qt user,

This is a Technology Preview release: a code snapshot that we are
making available to our customers. We're doing this because we want to
show you some of the new technologies that will go into the final Qt 4
release, and because we want you to have the opportunity to give us
your feedback. The feedback we receive will help us to ensure that the
final Qt 4 release provides as much value and productivity as
possible.

Qt 4 still is in a very active state of development. Not everything is
ready for prime time, and there are significant omissions.

Most importantly, this Technology Preview is not meant to be used in
production code or even for application development. Furthermore,
please do not attempt to start porting your Qt 3 based projects over
yet. Not all backwards compatibility functionality is in place yet,
and we have not yet finished the porting guide and the porting tools
that will help you with the process once the Qt 4 final release is
imminent.

What you \e{can} do is write new small programs to experience what the
next generation of Qt programming with be like. In particular, there
are five new technologies that we hope you will try out and give us
feedback on. All are new to Qt, written specifically for Qt 4:

\list 1
\i \link tulip-overview.html Tulip \endlink, a new set of template container classes.

\i \link interview-overview.html Interview \endlink, a model/view architecture for item views.

\i \link arthur-overview.html Arthur \endlink, the Qt 4 painting framework.

\i \link scribe-overview.html Scribe \endlink, the Unicode text
renderer with a public API for performing low-level text layout.

\i A modern action-based \link mainwindow-overview.html mainwindow, toolbar, menu, and docking
architecture \endlink.
\endlist

Follow the hyperlinks above for a detailed description for each of
the five areas, including the current state of development and our
plans for the final release. See also \link getting-started.html
Getting Started with Qt 4 \endlink for an overview of the main
portability issues.

This is a preview of some of the Qt 4 libraries, not of the entire
application development framework. Most notably, new versions of Qt
Designer and Qt Linguist are not included. But we do ship a version
of uic that allows you to experiment with .ui files generated by the
Qt 3 Designer. We also ship a ported version of Assistant to make it
easier to read the online documentation provided with this package,
although the Qt 4 documentation itself is still far from complete.

The Technology Preview is meant to be tested on a limited set of
platforms only, not the entire range of platforms targeted by the
final Qt product. The Technology Preview supports:

\list
\i GNU/Linux with gcc 2.95 or later (x86)
\i Mac OS X with its native gcc compiler
\i Microsoft Windows 2000 and later, with MSVC 6 or later
\endlist

Other operating systems and compilers might work but are not yet part
of the testing program.

\section1 How to provide feedback

Trolltech has set up a special mailing list, qt4-preview-feedback, for
discussion of Qt Technology Preview-related issues. To subscribe, send
a message containing just the word "subscribe" (without the quotes) to
qt4-preview-feedback-request@trolltech.com. We encourage you to use
this mailing list instead of qt-interest for preview-specific issues.
See http://lists.trolltech.com/ for more information on Trolltech's
mailing lists, including archived discussions.

\section1 Roadmap

Depending on the feedback from this Technology Preview, we will
provide a second Preview in Q3 2004, enter the beta phase in Q4 2004
and release the final Qt 4 in late Q1 2005.

Enjoy the Technology Preview: We hope you will have as much fun and
pleasure experimenting with it as we had designing and building it.

\e{--The Trolltech Qt 4 Team}
