<title>
Qt toolkit - Using the Meta Object Compiler
</title></head><body>

<h1>Using the Meta Object Compiler</h1>

The Meta Object Compiler, moc among friends, is the program which
handles the <a href=metaobjects.html>C++ extensions in Qt.</a>

<h2>Invoking moc</h2>

Here are the command-line options supported by the moc: 

<dl>
<dt> -o <var>file</var> <dd> Write output to <var>file</var> rather
than to stdout.
<dt> -f <dd> Force the generation of an #include statement in the
output.  This is the default for files whose name matches the regular
expression \.[hH][^.]* (ie. the extension starts with H or h).  This
option is only useful if you have header files that do not follow the
standard naming conventions.
<dt> -i <dd> Do not generate an #include statement in the output.
This may be used to run the moc on on a C++ file containing one or
more class declarations and #include the meta object code in the .cpp
file.  If both -i and -f are present, the last one wins.
<dt> -nw <dd> Do not generate any warnings.  Discouraged.
<dt> -ldbg <dd> Write a flood of lex debug information on stdout.
<dt> -dbg <dd> Treat all non-signal members as slots, for internal
debugging purposes.  This is not useful for programming Qt clients.
</dl>

<h2>Usage</h2>
moc is almost always invoked by make(1), not by hand.

<p>

moc is typically used with an input file containing class declarations
like this skeleton:
\code
    class YourClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    public:
        YourClass::YourClass( QObject * parent=0,
                              const char * name=0 );
        YourClass::~YourClass();

    signals:

    public slots:

    };
\endcode

<p>

Here is a useful makefile rule if you only use GNU make:

\code
    m%.cpp: %.h
            moc $lt; -o $@
\endcode

<p>

If you want to write portably, you can use individual rules of the
following form:

\code
    mNAME.cpp: NAME.h
            moc $&lt; -o $@
\endcode

<p>

You must also remember to add <var>mNAME.cpp</var> to your SOURCES
(substitute your favorite name) variable and <var>mNAME.o</var> to
your OBJECTS variable.

<p>

(While we prefer to name our C++ source files .cpp, the moc doesn't
know that, so you can use .C, .cc, .CC, .cxx or even .c++ if you
prefer.)

<p>

If you have class declarations in C++ files, we recommend that you use
a makefile rule like this:

\code
    NAME.o: mNAME.cpp
    
    mNAME.cpp: NAME.cpp
            moc -i $&lt; -o $@
\endcode

<p>

This guarantees that make(1) will run the moc before it compiles
<var>NAME.cpp.</var> You can then put

\code
    #include "nNAME.cpp"
\endcode

at the end of <var>NAME.cpp,</var> where all the classes declared in
that file are fully known.

<h2>Diagnostics</h2>

Sometimes you may get linkage errors, saying that
YourClass::className() is undefined or that YourClass lacks a vtbl.
Those errors happen most often when you forget to compile the
moc-generated C++ code or include that object file in the link
command.

<p>

The moc will warn you about a number of dangerous or illegal constructs.

<h2>Bugs</h2>

moc does not handle all of C++.  The main problem is that class
templates cannot have signals or slots.  This is an important bug.
Here is an example:

\code
    class SomeTemplate&lt;int&gt; : public QFrame {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    signals:
        void bugInMocDetected( int );
    };
\endcode

Less importantly, the following five constructs are illegal.  All five
have workarounds which we think are better alternatives, so fixing
these bugs is not a high priority for us.


<h3> Function pointers can not be arguments to signals or slots. </h3>

In most cases where you would consider that, we think inheritance is a
better alternative.  Here is an example of illegal syntax:

\code
    class someClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    public slots:
        void apply(void (*applyFunction)(QList*, void*), char*);
    };
\endcode

<p>
You can work around this restriction like this:
\code
    typedef void (*ApplyFunctionType)(QList*, void*);

    class someClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    public slots:
        void apply( ApplyFunctionType, char *);
    };
\endcode

<p>

(It may sometimes be even better to replace the function pointer with
inheritance and virtual functions, signals or slots.)

<h3>Friend declarations can not be placed in signals or slots sections</h3>

Sometimes it will work, but in general, friend declarations can
not be placed in signals or slots sections.  Put them in the good old
private, protected or public sections instead.  Here is an example of
the illegal syntax:

\code
    class someClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    signals:
        friend class ClassTemplate&lt;char&gt;;
    };
\endcode

<h3>Signals and slots cannot be upgraded</h3>

The C++ feature of upgrading an inherited member function to
public status is not extended to cover signals and slots.  Here is an
illegal example:

\code
    class Whatever : public QButtonGroup {
    [...]
    public slots:
        void QButtonGroup::buttonPressed;
    [...]
    };
\endcode
<p>
The QButtonGroup::buttonPressed() slot is protected.
<p>
C++ quiz: What happens if you try to upgrade a protected member
function which is overloaded?
<ol>
<li> All the functions are overloaded.
<li> That is not legal C++.
<!-- C++ ARM, section r.11.3 -->
</ol>

<h3>Type macros can not be used for signal and slot arguments</h3>

This is regrettable, but the moc places more emphasis on getting
modern syntax like templates and typedefs right than on anachronisms
like #define.  In other words, we don't like #define and don't want to
fix this problem.  Here is an illegal example:

\code
    #ifdef ultrix
    #define SIGNEDNESS(a) unsigned a
    #else
    #define SIGNEDNESS(a) a
    #endif

    class Whatever : public QObject {
    [...]
    signals:
        void someSignal( SIGNEDNESS(a) );
    [...]
    };
\endcode
<p>
A #define without arguments works.

<h3>Constructors can not be used in signals or slots sections</h3>

It is a mystery to me why anyone would put a constructor on
either the signals or slots sections.  You can not, anyway (except
that it happens to work in some cases).  Put them in private,
protected or public sections, where they belong.  Here is an example
of the illegal syntax:

\code
    class SomeClass : QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    public slots:
        SomeClass( QObject *parent, const char *name )
            : QObject( parent, name ) {}
    [...]
    };
\endcode
