/*! \class QSizePolicy qsizepolicy.h

\brief The QSizePolicy provides a simple compact way to express resizing behaviour.

\in###group ###

The class provides a way to describe the ability of a widget class to
change its geometry.  A (vertical) scroll bar is described as "really,
really wants to be of fixed width, but is eager to extend its length,
if possible"; a list box is described as "eager to grow in both
directions"; a push button is described as "the width will grow if
necessary, the height really wants to be fixed"; etc.

When a class provides a good QSizePolicy (the return value of
QWidget::sizePolicy()) and a sizeHint(), QLayout can do
natural-seeming and good layout management with a minimum of code on
behalf of the application programmer.

The bulk of the QSizePolicy is in two enums, SizeType and ExpandData.
SizeType lets you describe the widget's policy towards size change in
each dimension.  There are six values: <ul>

<li>\c Fixed - the widget is very, very reluctant to deviate from
sizeHint() in the relevant dimension.  (Example: The vertical scroll
bar is Fixed to sizeHint().width()).

<li>\c Minimum - the widget is willing, but not eager, to grow beyond
the size specified by sizeHint().  (Example: The push button is
willing to be wider than it has to be, but not eager.)

<li>\c Maximum - the widget is willing, but not eager, to shrink
beyond the size specified by sizeHint().  (No widgets in Qt have this
policy.  It is present mostly for symmetry.)

<li>\c Preferred - the widget is willing to shrink or grow if
necessary, but the sizeHint() is preferred, if possible.  (This is the
default, if you do not reimplement QWidget::sizePolicy().)

<li>\c MinimumExpanding - the widget is very, very reluctant to shrink
below sizeHint() but eager to grow beyond it.  (This is likely to be
the cases for the central widget in many application windows.  For
example, the text editing field in a word processor will likely have
this policy.)

<li>\c Expanding - the widget is willing, but not eager to shrink
below sizeHint(), and it is eager to grow beyond it.  (This too is
present mostly for symmetry.)

</ul>
