\title The Qt DOM classes

\target introDOM
\section1 Introduction to DOM

DOM provides an interface to access and change the content and structure of
an XML file. It makes a hierarchical view of the document (tree) 
available with the root element of the XML file serving as its root. 
Thus -- in contrast to the SAX2 interface -- an object model of the document 
is resident in memory after parsing which makes manipulation easy. 

In the Qt implementation of the DOM all
nodes in the document tree are subclasses of \l QDomNode.
The document itself is represented as a \l QDomDocument object.

Here are the available node classes and their potential children classes:

\list
\i \l QDomDocument: Possible children are
	\list
	\i \l QDomElement (at most one)
	\i \l QDomProcessingInstruction
	\i \l QDomComment
	\i \l QDomDocumentType
	\endlist
\i \l QDomDocumentFragment: Possible children are
	\list
	\i \l QDomElement
	\i \l QDomProcessingInstruction
	\i \l QDomComment
	\i \l QDomText
	\i \l QDomCDATASection
	\i \l QDomEntityReference
	\endlist
\i \l QDomDocumentType: No children
\i \l QDomEntityReference: Possible children are
	\list
	\i \l QDomElement
	\i \l QDomProcessingInstruction
	\i \l QDomComment
	\i \l QDomText
	\i \l QDomCDATASection
	\i \l QDomEntityReference
	\endlist
\i \l QDomElement: Possible children are
	\list
	\i \l QDomElement
	\i \l QDomText
	\i \l QDomComment
	\i \l QDomProcessingInstruction
	\i \l QDomCDATASection
	\i \l QDomEntityReference
	\endlist
\i \l QDomAttr: Possible children are
	\list
	\i \l QDomText
	\i \l QDomEntityReference
	\endlist
\i \l QDomProcessingInstruction: No children
\i \l QDomComment: No children
\i \l QDomText: No children
\i \l QDomCDATASection: No children
\i \l QDomEntity: Possible children are
	\list
	\i \l QDomElement
	\i \l QDomProcessingInstruction
	\i \l QDomComment
	\i \l QDomText
	\i \l QDomCDATASection
	\i \l QDomEntityReference
	\endlist
\i \l QDomNotation: No children
\endlist

With \l QDomNodeList and \l QDomNamedNodeMap two collection classes 
are provided: \l QDomNodeList is a list of nodes
whereas \l QDomNamedNodeMap is used to handle unordered sets of nodes
(often used for attributes).

The \l QDomImplementation class allows the user to query features of the
DOM implementation.

\section1 Further reading

To get started please refer to the \l QDomDocument documentation that
describes basic usage.
