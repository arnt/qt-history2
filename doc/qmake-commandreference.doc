\target About
\section1 About This Reference

This reference is a detailed index of all commandline options,
configurations and internal variables used by the \e qmake
cross-platform makefile generation utility.

For a higher level introduction to using \e qmake see the
\link qmake-guide.html qmake User's Guide \endlink.

\target Commands
\section1 Command Line Options

\section2 Syntax

\code
qmake [options] files
\endcode

\section2 Options

The following options can be specified on the command line to \e qmake:

\list
\i \c -o file <br>
	\e qmake output will be directed to \e file. If this argument
	is not specified qmake will try to guess a suitable name, if '-' is
	specified output is directed to stdout. 
\i \c -unix <br>
	\e qmake will run in unix mode.  In this mode Unix file
	naming and path conventions will be used. This is the default mode on all Unices.
\i \c -win32 <br>
	\e qmake will run in win32 mode.  In this mode Windows file naming and path
	conventions will be used. This is the default mode on Windows.
\i \c -d <br>
	\e qmake will output useful debugging information.
\i \c -t tmpl <br>
	\e qmake will override any set TEMPLATE variables with tmpl.
\i \c -help <br>
	\e qmake will go over these features and give some usefull help.
\endlist


QMake supports two different modes of operation. The first mode (and
default) is makefile generation, in this mode qmake will take a .pro file
and turn it into a proper system Makefile. This is the mode documented in
this guide, however there is an additional mode in qmake to generate .pro
files from source code.

To toggle between these modes you must specify in the first argument what
mode you want, if no mode is specified qmake will assume you want makefile
mode, the available mode switches are:

\list
\i \c -makefile <br>
	\e qmake output will be a makefile (\link #MakefileMode Makefile Mode \endlink).
\i \c -project <br>
	\e qmake output will be a project file (\link #ProjectfileMode Projectfile Mode \endlink).
\endlist

\target MakefileMode
\section3 Makefile Mode

In Makefile mode QMake will generate a makefile. Additionally you may
supply the following arguments in this mode:

\list
\i \c -nocache <br>
	\e qmake will ignore the .qmake.cache file.
\i \c -nodepend <br>
	\e qmake will not genereate any dependancy information.
\i \c -cache file <br>
	\e qmake will use \e file as the cache file, ignoring any other .qmake.cache file found
\i \c -spec spec <br>
	\e qmake will use \e spec as a path to platform-conpiler information and QMAKESPEC will be ignored.
\endlist

The \c files argument can be a list of one or more project files, separated
by spaces. You may also pass qmake assignments on the commandline here and
they will be processed before all files specified, for example:

qmake -makefile -unix -o Makefile "CONFIG+=test" test.pro 

This will generate a Makefile from test.pro, with Unix pathnames, however
many of these arguments aren't necesary as they are the default:

qmake "CONFIG+=test" test.pro 

\target ProjectfileMode
\section3 Projectfile Mode

In Projectfile mode QMake will generate a project file. Additionally you may
supply the following arguments in this mode:

\list
\i \c -nopwd <br>
	\e qmake will not look in your current working directory for
	source code and only use specified \c files
\endlist

The \c files argument can be a list of files or directories, if a directory
is specified this will be included in the DEPENDPATH and relevant code from
there will be included in the generated project file, if a file is given it
will go into the correct variable depending on extention (ie .ui files go
into INTERFACES, .cpp files go into SOURCES, etc).

\target SystemVariables
\section1 System Variables

For a higher level introduction to \e qmake variables and how they are used, see the
\link qmake-guide.html#Variables qmake User's Guide \endlink.

\list
\i \link #FrequentlyUsedSystemVariables Frequently Used System Variables \endlink
\i \link #RarelyUsedSystemVariables Rarely Used System Variables \endlink
\endlist


\target FrequentlyUsedSystemVariables
\section2 Frequently Used System Variables

The following variables are recognized by \e qmake and are used
most frequently when creating
\link qmake-guide.html project files \endlink.

<dl>

\target CONFIG
<dt>\c CONFIG

<dd> The \c CONFIG variable specifies project configuration and
compiler options.  The values will be recognized internally by
\e qmake and have several special meaning.  They are as follows.

These \c CONFIG values control compilation flags: 

\list
\i release - Compile with optimization enabled, ignored if
    "debug" is specified
\i debug - Compile with debug options enabled
\i warn_on - The compiler should emit more warnings than normally, ignored if
     "warn_off" is specified
\i warn_off - The compiler should emit no warnings or as few as possible.
\endlist

These options define the application/library type:

\list
\i qt - The target is a Qt application/library and requires Qt header
     files/library.  The proper include and library paths for the Qt
     library will automatically be added to the project.
\i opengl - The target requires the OpenGL (or Mesa)
    headers/libraries. The proper include and library paths for the
    these libraries will automatically be added to the project.
\i thread - The target is a multi-threaded application or library.  The
    proper defines and compiler flags will automatically be added to
    the project.
\i x11 - The target is a X11 application or library.  The proper
    include paths and libraries will automatically be added to the
    project.
\i windows - The target is a Win32 window application (app only). The
    proper include paths,compiler flags and libraries will
    automatically be added to the project.
\i console - The target is a Win32 console application (app only). The
    proper include paths, compiler flags and libraries will
    automatically be added to the
    project.
\i dll - The target is a shared object/DLL.The proper
    include paths, compiler flags and libraries will automatically be
    added to the project.
\i staticlib - The target is a static library (lib only).  The proper
    compiler flags will automatically be added to the project.
\i plugin - The target is a plugin (lib only). This enables dll as well.
\endlist

The \c CONFIG variable will also be checked when resolving
\link qmake-guide.html#Scopes scope \endlink.  You may assign anything to
this variable.  

For example:

\code
CONFIG += qt console newstuff
...
newstuff {
	SOURCES += new.cpp
	HEADERS += new.h
}
\endcode


\target DEFINES
<dt>\c DEFINES

<dd>\e qmake adds the values of this variable as compiler C
preprocessor macros (-D option).  

For example:

\code 
DEFINES += USE_MY_STUFF QT_DLL
\endcode


\target DEF_FILE
<dt>\c DEF_FILE

<dd>\e {win32/app only}.

Specifies a .def file to be included in the project.


\target DESTDIR
<dt>\c DESTDIR

<dd>Specifies where to put the \link #TARGET target \endlink file. 

For example:

\code 
  DESTDIR = ../../lib
\endcode

Also see \link #DirectoryNote this note \endlink.

\target DLLDESTDIR
<dt>\c DLLDESTDIR

<dd>Specifies where to copy the \link #TARGET target \endlink dll.

Also see \link #DirectoryNote this note \endlink.

\target HEADERS
<dt>\c HEADERS

<dd>Defines the header files for the project.  

\e qmake will generate dependancy information (unless -nodepend
is specified on the \link #Commands command line \endlink) for the
specified headers.  \e qmake will also automatically detect if
\e moc is required by the classes in these headers, and add the
appropriate dependancies and files to the project for generating and
linking the moc files. 

For example:

\code
HEADERS	= myclass.h \
	  login.h \
	  mainwindow.h
\endcode

See also \target #SOURCES SOURCES \endlink.


\target INCLUDEPATH
<dt>\c INCLUDEPATH

<dd>This variable specifies the #include directories which should be
searched when compiling the project. Use ';' or space as a the
directory separator. 

For example:

\code
  INCLUDEPATH = c:\msdev\include d:\stl\include
\endcode


\target INTERFACES
<dt>\c INTERFACES

<dd>This variable specifies the .ui files (see the \link
designer.html Qt Designer \endlink) to be processed through \e uic
before compiling.  All dependancies, headers and source files required
to build these .ui files will automatically be added to the project.

For example:

\code
INTERFACES = mydialog.ui \
	     mywidget.ui \
             myconfig.ui
\endcode


\target LEXSOURCES
<dt>\c LEXSOURCES

<dd>This variable contains a list of lex source files.  All
dependancies, headers and source files will automatically be added to
the project for building these lex files.  

For example:

\code
LEXSOURCES = lexer.l
\endcode
 

\target LIBS
<dt>\c LIBS

<dd>This variable contains a list of libraries to be linked into the
project.  

For example:

\code

win32:LIBS += c:\mylibs\math.lib
\endcode


\target MOC_DIR
<dt>\c MOC_DIR

<dd>This variable specifies the directory where all intermediate moc
files (see \link metaobjects.html meta object compiler\endlink)
should be placed.  

For example:

\code
unix:MOC_DIR = ../myproject/tmp
win32:MOC_DIR = c:\myproject\tmp
\endcode

Also see \link #DirectoryNote this note \endlink.


\target OBJECTS_DIR
<dt>\c OBJECTS_DIR

<dd>This variable specifies the directory where all intermediate
object should be placed.  

For example:

\code
unix:OBJECTS_DIR = ../myproject/tmp
win32:OBJECTS__DIR = c:\myproject\tmp
\endcode

Also see \link #DirectoryNote this note \endlink.


\target OBJMOC
<dt>\c OBJMOC

<dd>This variable is set by \e qmake if files can be found that
contain the Q_OBJECT macro.  \c OBJMOC contains the
name of all intermediate moc object files. The value of this variable
is typically handled by \e qmake or \link #QMAKESPEC qmake.conf \endlink and rarely needs to be
modified.


\target REQUIRES
<dt>\c REQUIRES

<dd>This is a special variable processed by \e qmake.  If the
contents of this variable do not appear in CONFIG by the time this
variable is assigned to then a minimal makefile will be generated that
states what dependancies (the values assigned to REQUIRES) were
missing.


<dt>\c SOURCES

<dd>This variable contains the name of all source files in the project.  

For example:

\code
SOURCES	= myclass.cpp \
	  login.cpp \
	  mainwindow.cpp

\endcode

modified.




<dt>\c SUBDIRS

<dd>This variable, when used with the 'subdir'
\link #TEMPLATE TEMPLATE \endlink contains the names of all subdirectories
to be built by the project.

For example:

\code
SUBDIRS = kernel \
	  tools
\endcode


\target TARGET
<dt>\c TARGET
<dd>This contains the name of the project target.

For example:

\code
TEMPLATE = app
TARGET = myapp
SOURCES = main.cpp
\endcode

The above project file would produce an executable named 'myapp' on
unix and 'myapp.exe' on windows.




<dt>\c TEMPLATE

<dd>This variable contains the name of the template to use when
generating the project.  The allowed values are:

\list
\i app - Creates a makefile for building applications (the default)

\i subdirs - Creates a makefile for building targets in subdirectories
\i vcapp - \e {win32 only}  Creates an application project file
\i vclib - \e {win32 only}  Creates a library project file

\endlist

For example:

\code
TEMPLATE = lib
SOURCES = main.cpp
TARGET = mylib
\endcode




<dt>\c VERSION

<a name="DirectoryNote">*</a> For all project files that specify a directory and are interpreted by qmake
(DESTDIR, OBJECTS_DIR, MOC_DIR, etc) the directory will be created when qmake
is called, ie before the 'make' command is specified. This is to assure
portablity.

\target Functions
\section1 Functions

For a higher level introduction to using \e qmake functions see
the \link qmake-guide.html#Functions \e qmake User's
Guide \endlink.

\e qmake recognizes the following functions:

<dl>

<dt>\c include( filename )

<dd>This function will include the contents of \e filename into the
current project at the point it was included.  The function succeeds
if \e filename was included, otherwise it fails. You can check the
return value of this function using a
\link qmake-guide.html#Scopes scope \endlink.

For example:

\code
include( shared.pri )
OPTIONS = standard custom
!include( options.pri ) {
	message( "No custom build options specified" )
	OPTIONS -= custom
}
\endcode

<dt>\c contains( variablename, value )

<dd>This function will succeed if the variable \e variablename
contains the value \e value.  You can check the return value of this
function using a \link qmake-guide.html#Scopes scope \endlink.

For example:

\code
contains( drivers, network ) {
	# drivers contains 'network'
	message( "Configuring for network build..." )
	HEADERS += network.h
	SOURCES += network.cpp
}
\endcode

<dt>\c count( variablename, number )

<dd>This function will succeed if the variable \e variablename
contains \e number elements, otherwise it will fails.  You can check
the return value of this function using a
\link qmake-guide.html#Scopes scope \endlink.

For example:

\code
MYVAR = one two three
count( MYVAR, 3 ) {
	# always true
}
\endcode



<dt>\c isEmpty( variablename )

<dd>This function will succeed if the variable \e variablename is
empty (same as \c count(variable, 0)).

<dt>\c system( command )

<dd>This function will execute string in a secondary shell and will
succeed if the command exits with a exit status of 1.You can check the
return value of this function using a
\link qmake-guide.html#Scopes scope \endlink.

For example:

\code
  system(ls /bin):HAS_BIN=FALSE
\endcode

<dt>\c message( string )

<dd>This function will always succeed, and will display the given
\e string to the user.

<dt>\c error( string )

<dd>This function will never return.  It will display the given \e
string to the user, and then exit \e qmake. This function should
only be used for very fatal configurations

For example:

\code
  release:debug:error(You can't have release and debug at the same time!)
\endcode

</dl>

\target Environmemt
\section1 Environment Variables and Configuration

For a higher level introduction to using \e qmake environment
variables and configuration options see the
\link qmake-guide.html#QMAKESPEC qmake User's Guide \endlink.


\target QMAKESPEC
\section2 QMAKESPEC

\e qmake requires a platform and compiler description file which
contains many default values used to generate appropriate makefiles.
The standard Qt distribution comes with many of these files, located
in the 'mkspecs' subdirectory of the Qt installation.

The \link qmake-guide.html#QMAKESPEC QMAKESPEC \endlink environment
variable can contain any of the following:

\list
\i A complete path to a directory containing a \link qmake-guide.html qmake.conf \endlink file.  In this case \e qmake will open the qmake.conf file from within that directory.  If the file does not exist, \e qmake will exit with an error.
\i The name of a platform-compiler combination.  In this case, \e qmake will search in the directory specified by the QTDIR environment variable.
\endlist

Note: the QMAKESPEC path will automatically be added to the
\link #INCLUDEPATHS INCLUDEPATHS \endlink system variable.

\target cache
\section2 Cache File

The cache file (mentioned above in the options) is a special file
\e qmake will read to find settings not specified in the
qmake.conf file, the .pro file, or the command line. If neither -path
nor -nocache are specified qmake will try to find a file called
.qmake.cache in parent directories.  If it fails to find this file it
will silently ignore this step of processing.
