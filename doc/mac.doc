\title Qt/Mac differences

This file will outline known issues and possible workarounds for
limitations on Mac OS X with Qt. This list will not always be complete, so
please contact Trolltech support with issues you find to be missing:

\section1 \link qcursor.html QCursor \endlink

Due to Mac OS X having only 16x16 custom cursors QCursor is limited by this
as well. For now the only workaround to this problem is to use a small
cursor (16x16).

\section1 Anti-aliased text

Qt/Mac (starting with 3.0.5) has introduced some support for smooth text as
suggested by Apple's Aqua Style Guildelines. This support is limited to Mac
OS X >10.1.4, when this version is not detected it will fallback to the old
text rendering library.
