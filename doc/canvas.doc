\title Qt Canvas Module

The canvas module provides a highly optimized 2D graphic area called \l
QCanvas. The canvas can contain an arbitrary number of \link QCanvasItem
QCanvasItems \endlink. Items can have an arbitrary shape, size and
content, can be freely moved around in the canvas, and can be checked
for collisions. (If you're interested in 3D graphics see Qt's 
<a href="opengl.html">OpenGL module</a>.)

The canvas module uses a document/view model. The \l QCanvasView class
is used to show a particular view of a canvas. Multiple views can operate
on the same canvas at the same time. Every view can use an arbitrary
transformation matrix on the canvas which makes it easy to implement
features such as zooming.

Qt provides a number of predefined \l QCanvas items as listed below. 
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasItem </td>
<td valign="top">An abstract base class for all canvas items.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasEllipse </td>
<td valign="top">An ellipse or "pie segment".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasLine </td>
<td valign="top">A line segment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasPolygon </td>
<td valign="top">A polygon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasPolygonalItem </td>
<td valign="top">A base class for items that have a non-rectangular
shape. Most canvas items derive from this class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasRectangle </td>
<td valign="top">A rectangle. The rectangle cannot be tilted or rotated.
Rotated rectangles can be drawn using \l QCanvasPolygon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasSpline </td>
<td valign="top">A multi-bezier spline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasSprite </td>
<td valign="top">An animated pixmap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">\l QCanvasText </td>
<td valign="top">A text string.</td>
</tr>
</table>

 Additionally, the two classes, \l QCanvasPixmap and \l
 QCanvasPixmapArray are used by \l QCanvasSprite to show animated and
 moving pixmaps on the canvas.

More specialized items can be created by inheriting from one of the
canvas item classes. It is easiest to inherit from one of
QCanvasItem's derived classes (usually \l QCanvasPolygonalItem) rather
than inherit QCanvasItem directly.
