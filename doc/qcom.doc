/*!
  \class QUnknownInterface qcom.h
  \brief The QUnknownInterface class is the base class for all interfaces of the Qt Component Model.

  \preliminary
  \ingroup componentmodel
  \ingroup mainclasses

  All interfaces in the component object model are derived from the QUnknownInterface. This 
  interface provides control of the object's lifetime and the ability to navigate a component 
  implementing multiple interfaces.
  The object's lifetime is controlled using a reference count that is increased and
  decreased using the functions addRef and release, respectively.
  The queryInterface function determines whether the component supports a specific interface.
  For every interface a Unique Universal Identifier (UUID) is provided to identify requests
  for the interface. In Qt, this identifier is wrapped in the \link QUuid QUuid \endlink class
  that provides convenience operators for comparison and copying.
*/

/*!
  \fn QRESULT  QUnknownInterface::queryInterface( const QUuid &request, QUnknownInterface** iface )

  Sets \a iface to point to an interface specified with \a request, or 0 if this 
  interface can't provide the requested interface. An implementation of this function 
  must call addRef() on the pointer it returns.
  Possible return values for this function are QS_OK when the call succeeds, or QE_NOINTERFACE
  if the requested interface cannot be provided.

  Example:
  \code
  QRESULT MyComponent::queryInterface( const QUuid &request, QUnknownInterface** iface )
  {
      *iface = 0;
      if ( request == IID_QUnknownInterface )
          *iface = this;
      else if ( request == IID_... )
          *iface = (...*)this;
      ...
      else
          return QE_NOINTERFACE

     (*iface)->addRef();
     return QS_OK;
  }
  \endcode

  There are five requirements for implementations of queryInterface:
  \list
  \i Always the same QUnknownInterface
  For any component, a query for the QUnknownInterface must always return the same pointer value to
  allow a client to determine whether two interfaces point to the same component.
  \i Static set of interfaces
  The number of interfaces for which queryInterface returns a valid pointer must not change.
  \i Reflexive
  If a client holding a pointer to one interface queries for that interface, the call must succeed.
  \i Symmetric
  If a client holding a pointer to one interface queries for another, a query through the obtained
  interface for the first interface must succeed.
  \i Transitive
  If a client holding a pointer to one interface queries successfully for a second, and queries that
  successfully for a third interface, a query for that third interface on the first interface must succeed.
  \endlist

  \sa addRef(), release()
*/

/*!
  \fn ulong QUnknownInterface::addRef()

  Increases the reference counter for this interface by one and returns
  the old reference count.

  Example:
  \code
  int MyComponent::addRef()
  {
      return ref++;
  }
  \endcode

  This function must be called when this interface is returned as a result of a
  queryInterface() call. It should be called for every new copy of a pointer to
  this interface.

  \sa queryInterface(), release()
*/

/*!
  \fn ulong QUnknownInterface::release()

  Decreases the reference count for this interface by one and returns
  the new reference count. If the reference count falls to 0, the object is freed from memory.

  Example:
  \code
  int MyComponent::release()
  {
      if ( !--ref ) {
          delete this;
	  return 0;
      }
      return ref;
  }
  \endcode

  This function should be called whenever a copy of a pointer to this interface is no longer needed.
