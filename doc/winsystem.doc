\title Window System-specific Notes

Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, so almost the entire API is the
same on all platforms and window systems. If you wish to use
platform-specific features, and still maintain a platform-independent
source tree, you should protect the platform-specific code using the
appropriate \c{#ifdef} statements (see below).

For information about which platforms are supported by Qt, see the
\link http://www.trolltech.com/products/platforms/ Platform
Notes\endlink.

\target x11
\section1 Qt/X11

When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_X11} is defined.
