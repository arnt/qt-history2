<h1 align="center">Windowsystem-specific Notes</h1><br clear="all">

Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, so almost the entire API is the
same on all platforms and windowsystems. However some tasks
may require you to write small windowsystem-specific tasks.
This page documents the windowsystem-specific parts of the Qt API.
Note that any use of these features renders your application non-portable
to other Qt-supported windowsystems, so protect such code with appropriate
"#ifdef" directives (see below), preferrably with code for each platform to which
you wish to retain portability.

<a name=x11>
<h2>X11</h2>
</a>

When compiling for this platform, the macro <tt>_WS_X11_</tt> is defined.

<i>Not documented here. Please contact Trolltech Technical Support
if you have queries.</i>

<a name=win>
<h2>Windows</h2>
</a>

When compiling for this platform, the macro <tt>_WS_WIN_</tt> is defined.

<i>Not documented here. Please contact Trolltech Technical Support
if you have queries.</i>

<a name=qws>
<h2>Qt/Embedded</h2>
</a>

When compiling for this platform, the macro <tt>_WS_QWS_</tt> is defined
(the window system is literally the Qt Window System).
