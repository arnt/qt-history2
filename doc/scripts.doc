\title The text engine in Qt

Qt-3 comes with a completely redesigned text processing and layouting engine, that is 
used throughout the whole library.

It has support for most writing systems that are used in todays world, as
<ul>
<li> Latin languages
<li> Cyrillic
<li> Greek
<li> Hebrew
<li> Arabic
<li> Chinese
<li> Japanese
<li> Korean
<li> Thai
<li> Vietnamese
\endlist

Many of these writing systems exhibit special features as for example
<ul>
<li>Special line breaking behaviour. Some of the asian languages are written without
spaces between words. Line breaking can occur either after every character (with exceptions)
as in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, or after logical word boundaries as in Thai.
<li>Bidirectional writing. Arabic and Hebrew are written from right to left, while numbers
and embedded english text is still written left to right. The exact behaviour is defined
in the \link http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/ Unicode Technical Report #9 \endlink.
<li>Non spacing or diacritical marks. Most people know these as accents or umlauts in
european languages. Some languages as for example Vietnamese make extensive use of these
marks and some characters can have a few marks at the same time to clarify pronounciation.
<li>Ligatures. In special contexts, some characters following each other directly get replaced by a 
combined glyph forming a so called ligature. Known examples are the ff and fi ligatures used in 
typesetting of some european books.
</ul>

Except for ligatures which are currently only supported for a special case in arabic, 
Qt tries to take care of all the special features listed above. The programmer will usually never
have to worry about these features as long as he uses Qt's input (QLineEdit and
QTextView derived classes) and displaying controls (QLabel).

Support for these writing systems is transparent to the programmer and completeley encapsulated
in Qt's text engine. This implies, that a programmer using Qt does not need to have any knowledge
about the writing system used in this language, except for a few small things listed below.
<ul>
<li>\l QPainter::drawText( int x, int y, const QString &str ) will always draw the string with it's left edge 
at the position specified with the (x/y) parameter. This will usually give you left aligned strings, while
in an arabic or hebrew application strings are usually right aligned. Using the version of drawText, that 
takes a QRect should solve these issues, as alignment will then be done according to language.
<li>When you write your own text input controls, use \l QFontMetrics::charWidth() to determine
the width of a character in a string. In some langauges (mainly arabic), the width and shape of a glyph changes 
with the surrounding characters. Writing input controls usually requires a certain knowledge of
the scripts it is going to be used in. Usually the easier way is to subclass QLineEdit or QTextView.
</ul>
