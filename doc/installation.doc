\title Installation

The installation procedure is different for the different Qt platforms:

\list
 \i \link install-x11.html Qt/X11 \endlink
 \i \link install-win.html Qt/Windows \endlink
 \i \link install-qws.html Qt/Embedded \endlink
\endlist

*/

/*! \page install-x11.html

\title Installing Qt/X11

You may need to be root, depending on the permissions of the directories
where you choose to install Qt.

\list 1
\i  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

\code
    cd /usr/local
    gunzip qt-x11-version.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
    tar xf qt-x11-version.tar       # unpack it
\endcode

    This creates the directory /usr/local/qt-\e version containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Rename qt-\e version to qt (or make a symlink):

\code
    mv qt-version qt
\endcode

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /usr/local/qt.

\i  Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. Create the
    file if it is not there already.

    \list
    \i QTDIR -- wherever you installed Qt
    \i PATH -- to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
    \i MANPATH -- to access the Qt man pages
    \i LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- for the shared Qt library
    \endlist

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:

\code
    QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
    PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
    MANPATH=$QTDIR/man:$MANPATH
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    export QTDIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\endcode

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

\code
    setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
    setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
    setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/man:$MANPATH
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\endcode

    After you have done this, you will need to login again, or
    re-source the profile before continuing, so that at least $QTDIR
    is set.  The installation will give an error message and not
    proceed otherwise.

\i  Install your license file.  For the free edition, you do not need
    a license file.  For Professional and Enterprise editions, install
    your license file as described in your distribution.

\i  Compile the Qt library, and build the example programs,
    the tutorial and the tools (eg. the Designer) as follows.

    Type:
\code
    ./configure
\endcode

    This will configure the Qt library for your machine. Note that
    GIF support is turned off by default. Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.

    To create the library and compile all examples and the tutorial:
\code
    make
\endcode
    If your platform or compiler is not supported, read PORTING.  If it is
    supported but you have problems, see
    \l http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/.

\i  In very few cases you may need to run /sbin/ldconfig or something
    similar at this point if you are using shared libraries.

    If you have problems running the example programs, e.g. messages like
\code
    can't load library 'libqt.so.2'
\endcode
    you probably need to put a reference to the qt library in a
    configuration file and run /sbin/ldconfig as root on your system.
    And don't forget to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as explained in 2) above.

\i  The online HTML documentation is installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/html/
    The main page is /usr/local/qt/doc/html/index.html
    The man pages are installed in /usr/local/qt/doc/man/
\endlist

You're done.  Qt is now installed.

*/

/*! \page install-win.html

\title Installing Qt/Windows

The Qt/Windows distribution is distributed as a self-extracting archive
with a built-in installer. Just follow the installation wizard.

Once installed, you may want to unpack alternative makefile sets which
are packaged in the \c mkfiles directory -- unpack them directly
into you Qt directory, overwriting previous makefiles.
