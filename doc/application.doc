\title Walkthrough: A Simple Application

This walkthrough shows simple use of \l QMainWindow, \l QMenuBar, \l
QPopupMenu, \l QToolBar and \l QStatusBar - the classes that every
modern application window tends to use.

It further shows some use of \l QWhatsThis (for simple help) and a
typical main() using \l QApplication.

Finally, it shows a typical printout function that uses \l QPrinter.

<h2>The declaration of ApplicationWindow</h2

Here's the header file in full:

\include application/application.h

There's nothing much particular about this.  It declares a class that
inherits QMainWindow, with some slots and some private variables.  And
it uses a class predeclarations to speed up compiles: \c
QMultiLineEdit, \c QToolBar and \c QPopupMenu are declared, not
included.  make depend then won't think that every .cpp file that
includes application.h needs to be recompiled when e.g. qpopupmenu.h
changes.

<a href="simplemain"></a>
<h2>The simple main()</h2

Here's examples/main.cpp, in full.

\include application/main.cpp

We'll go over main() in detail.

\skipto argc
\printline argc
\printline QApplication

We create a QApplication object with the usual constructor and let it
parse \e argc and \e argv so that on X11, this program behaves as X
programs are expected to.

\printline ApplicationWindow
\printline setCaption
\printline show

We create an ApplicationWindow as a top-level widget, set its window
system caption to "Document 1", and show() it.

<a name="close"></a>
\printline connect

When the application's last window is closed, it should quit.

\printline exec

Having completed the application initialization, we start the main
event loop (the GUI), and eventually return the error code
QApplication returns when it leaves the event loop.
(\l QApplication::exit() lets any part of the program set this code in
a way that doesn't prohibit an orderly closedown.)

\printline }

<h2>The implementation of ApplicationWindow</h2>

\dontinclude application/application.cpp

Since the implementation is much larger (almost 200 lines) we won't
include it in full but instead include bits and pieces as necessary.
We skip the preliminary #include and some text constants, and start
with the constructor.

\skipto ApplicationWindow::ApplicationWindow
\printline ApplicationWindow::ApplicationWindow
\printuntil {

ApplicationWindow inherits QMainWindow, the Qt class that provides
typical application main windows, with menu bars, tool bars, etc.

\skipto id
\printuntil QPrinter

The application example can print things, and we chose to have a
QPrinter object lying around so that when the user changes a setting
during one printing, the new setting will be the default next time.

\printline QPixmap

This example is simple enough to have just three commands.  These
variables are used to hold the icons for each of them.

\printline QToolBar

We create a tool bar in \e this window for putting some tools in.

\printuntil SLOT(print())

And then we create three tool buttons in that tool bar, each with the
appropriate icons and tool-tip text.  The three buttons are connected
to slots in this object, for example the "Print File" button is
connected to ApplicationWindow::print().

\printline whatsThisButton

Then we create a fourth button in the toolbar: A special button that
provides "What's This?" help.  This must be set up using a special
function, as its mouse interface needs to be a little unusual.

\printuntil filePrint

We add What's This? help for each of the three buttons, and tell the
QML engine that when a help text wants the "fileopen" image, it should
use the pixmap we've defined.

\printline QPopupMenu
\printuntil Key_Q

We create a QPopupMenu item for the File menu, add it to the menu bar,
populate it with three commands, and set What's This? help for them.

Note in particular how What's This? help and pixmaps are used in both
the toolbar (above) and the menu bar (here).

\printline help
\printuntil whatsThis

We create a Help menu, add it to the menu bar, and insert a few
commands in the Help menu.

\printline QMultiLineEdit
\printline setFocus
\printline setCentralWidget

We create a multi-line edit widget, set the initial focus to be there,
and make it the central widget of this window.

QMainWindow::centralWidget() is the meat: It's what the menu bar,
status bar and tool bars are all arranged around.  Since this
application is an editor, the central widget is a text editing widget
:)

\printline statusBar

We make the status bar say "Ready" for two seconds at startup, just to
tell the user that this window has finished initialization and can be
used.

\printline resize

We provide a nice default size for the new window.

\printline }

That's it.

\printline ::~
\printuntil }

The only thing this widget needs to do in its destructor is delete the
printer it created.  All the other objects are child widgets, which Qt
will delete as appropriate.  Simple.

\printline ::newDoc
\printuntil }

This slot, connected to the File->New menu item and the "new file"
tool button, simply creates a new ApplicationWindow, sets some size
and shows it.

\printline ::load
\printuntil }

This slot is connected to the "load file" menu item and tool button.
As you can see, it asks the user for a file name and then either loads
that file or gives an error message in the status bar.

(We give an error message in the status bar since that's less
bothersome.  We could have used a \l QMessageBox, but since we assume
the user will notice that no file was loaded, we just use the status
bar, and the user won't need to hit Enter to make some window go
away.)

\printline ::load
\printuntil statusBar
\printline }

This function loads a file into the editor.  It takes care to turn off
auto-update of the editor, for faster loading and less flicker.  When
it's done, it sets the window system caption to the file name and
displays a success message for two seconds in the status bar.

\printline ::save
\printuntil close

This function saves the current file.  Nothing remarkable in the first
part.

\printline setEdited

Tell the editor that the contents haven't been edited since the last
save.  When the user closes the window, ApplicationWindow may want to
ask "Save?".

\printline setCaption

It may be that the document was saved under a different name than the
caption, so we set the window caption just to be sure.

\printuntil }

That was all.

\printline ::saveAs
\printuntil message
\printline }
\printline }

This function asks for a new name, saves the document under that name,
and implicitly changes the window system caption to the new name.

<a name="printer"></a>

\printline ::print
\printuntil pageNo

print() is called by the File->Print menu item and the "print" tool
button.

Since we don't want to print to the very edges of the paper, we use a
little margin: 10 points.  And we keep track of the page count.

\printline setup

QPrinter::setup() invokes a print dialog, configures the printer
object, and returns TRUE if the user wants to print or FALSE if not.
So, we test the return value, and if it's TRUE, we...

\printline message

... set a status bar message in case printing takes any time.

\printline QPainter
\printuntil surface

We create a painter for the output, select font, and set up some
variables we'll need.

\printline for

For each line in the text editing widget, we want to print it.

\printline if

Before we print each line: Is there space for it on the current page,
given the margins we want to use?  IF not, we want to start a new
page.

\printline QString
\printuntil yPos

Four lines to tell the user what we're doing, two lines to do it.

\printline }

Okay, now we know there's space for this line.

\printuntil textLine

Use the painter to print it.

In Qt, output to printer use the exact same code as output to screen,
pixmaps and picture metafiles.  Therefore, we don't call a QPrinter
function to draw text, we call a QPainter function.  QPainter works on
all the output devices and has a device independent API.  Most of its
code is device-independent, too, which means that it's less likely
that your application will have odd bugs.  (If the same code is used
to print as to draw on the screen, it's less likely that you'll have
printing-only or screen-only bugs.)

\printline yPos

Keep count of how much of the paper we've used.

\printline }

At this point we've printed all of the text in the editing widget.

\printline end
\printline message

So we tell the printer to finish off the last page and tell the user
that we're done.

\printline else
\printline message
\printline }

If the user did not want to print (and \l QPrinter::setup() returned
FALSE), we acknowledge that.

\printline }

Tha's all.  We have printed a text document.

<a name="closeEvent"></a>
\printline ::closeEvent
\printline {

This event get to process window-system close events.  A close event
is subtly different from a hide event: hide may often mean "iconify"
but close means that the window is going away for good.

\printline edited
\printline accept
\printline return
\printline }

If the text hasn't been edited, we just accept the event.  The window
will be closed, and since we used the \c WDestructiveClose widget
flag, the widget will be deleted.

\printline QMessageBox
\printuntil }
\printline }

We know the text has been edited, so we ask the user: What do you want
to do?  If the user wants to save and then exit, we do that.  If the
user wants to not exit, we ignore the close event (there is a chance
that we can't block it but we try).  If the user just wants to exit,
abandoning the edits, that's very simple.

\printline ::about
\printuntil aboutQt
\printuntil }

These two slots use ready-made "about" functions to say a little about
this program and the GUI toolkit it uses.  (You don't need to provide
an About Qt in your programs, but if you use Qt for free we'd
appreciate it if you tell people what you're using.)

That's all.  A complete, almost useful application with nice help.
Almost as good as the "editors" some computer vendors have shipped
with their desktops.  In less than 300 lines of code.
