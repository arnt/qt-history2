<h1 align=center>About Qt</h1>

<p>Qt is a cross-platform C++ GUI application framework. It provides
application developers with all the functionality needed to build
state-of-the-art graphical user interfaces. Qt is fully
object-oriented, easily extensible, and allows true component
programming. It is supported on Windows 95/98/NT/2000, Linux, Sun
Solaris, HP-UX, Digital Unix, IBM AIX, SGI IRIX and a wide range of
other platforms. Since the commercial introduction of Qt in early
1996, Qt has formed the basis of many hundreds of successful
applications worldwide. Qt is also the basis of the popular KDE Linux
desktop environment, included in all major Linux distributions.

<p>Qt is a product of <a href="troll.html">Troll Tech</a>.

<p>Qt is released under two different licenses:

<dl>
<dd><b>Qt Professional Edition</b> is provided for commercial
software development. It includes free upgrades and Technical Support
Service. For the latest prices, please see the Troll Tech web site, <a
href="http://www.troll.no/pricing.html">Pricing and Availability</a>
page, or contact <a href="mailto:sales@troll.no">sales@troll.no</a>.

<p>

<dd><b>Qt Free Edition</strong> is the Unix/X11 version of Qt
available for development of <em>free/Open Source software</em>
only. It is provided free of charge under the <a

<title>Common Problems</title>
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h1 align=center>Common Problems</h1>

<h2>Link error, complaining about a lack of \c vtbl, \c _vtbl, \c
__vtbl or similar </h2>

This indicates that you include the Q_OBJECT macro in a class declaration
and probably also run the moc, but forget to link the moc-generated object
code into your executable. Read <a href="moc.html">Using the Meta Object
Compiler</a> for details on how to use moc.

<h2>Using different versions of Qt on the same machine</h2>

Qt programs need the following components of the Qt distribution: <ul>

<li><b>Header files - Compile time</b>

Programmers need to include the Qt header files. Those with a
command-line compiler will typically use options such as \c
/I%QTDIR%\include or \c -I${QTDIR}/include.  They will need the header
files of the version of Qt they wish to build programs with.  The
header files are in the \c include subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<li><b>Meta Object Compiler - Compile time</b>

Programmers need to run the Meta Object Compiler - \e moc.  The moc is
found in the \c bin subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<li><b>Static or shared libraries - Link time</b>

Programmers need to link with static or shared libraries. Those with a
command-line compiler will typically use options such as \c
/L%QTDIR%\lib\qt.lib or \c -L${QTDIR}/lib \c -lqt.  They will need the
libraries of the version of Qt they wish to build programs with.  The
libraries are in the \c lib subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<li><b>Shared libraries - Run time</b>

Users of programs built with the shared Qt libraries need these same
shared libraries to run the programs.  The libraries are in the \c lib
subdirectory of Qt distributions.  Shared libraries are made available
to programs in places such as \c C:\windows\system on Windows
platforms, directories listed in file \c /etc/ld.so.conf on Linux,
standard \c lib directories on Unix, or the directories listed in the
environment variable \c ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} on Unix/Linux.

</ul>

Binary packages usually consist of two parts:

<ul>
<li>run time libraries in the run time package, usually called
\c qt2.

<li>header files, the moc and static libraries in the developers' kit,
usually called \c qt2-dev.

</ul>

Depending on how you are using Qt, you need to make specific parts of
the Qt distribution available to your programs.  Typical situations are
described below.<ul>

<li><b>Developers building for a single version of Qt on Unix
- Qt packages</b>

You build programs with a single version of Qt, but you still need to
run programs linked with another version of Qt.  You are typically a
Linux developer who builds programs for Qt 2.x on a KDE desktop based
on Qt 1.4x.  Qt packages are usually split into a shared library
package with a name like \c qt and a developer package with a name
like \c qt-dev.  You will need the appropriate packages:

<ul>

<li>To build programs you will need the header files, the moc and the
libraries of Qt 2.x. They are included in the developer package of
Qt 2.x (\c qt2-dev or the like).

<li>To run programs you will need the shared libraries of Qt 2.x
and Qt 1.4x. They are included in the regular packages
of Qt 2.x (\c qt2 or the like) and Qt 1.4x (\c qt1
or the like).

</ul>Just install those 3 packages. You may need to set the
environment variable \c QTDIR.

<li><b>Developers building for two versions of Qt on Unix
- Qt sources</b>

You build and run programs for Qt v1.4x and Qt 2.x. You will need:<ul>

<li>the \e header \e files, the \e moc> and the \e libraries of Qt 2.x
and Qt 1.4x to build programs,

<li>the shared libraries of Qt 2.x and Qt 1.4x to run programs (if you
use shared linking).

</ul>

Get source distributions of both Qt 1.4x and Qt 2.x. <ol>

<li>Install and build Qt 1.4x and Qt 2.x, usually in \c /opt or
\c /usr/local. In the case of \c /opt:

\code
$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c qt-1.44.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-1.44
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-1.44
$ configure \<...\>
$ make

$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c qt-2.1.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-2.1.0
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.1.0
$ configure \<...\>
$ make
\endcode

<li>Make shared libraries available to programs at run time. Either
add both \c /opt/qt-1.44 and \c /opt/qt-2.0.1 to your environment
variable \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH or make links to the libraries in a
standard directory like \c /usr/local/lib:

\code
cd /usr/local/lib
ln -s /opt/qt-1.44/lib/libqt.so.1 .
ln -s /opt/qt-2.1.0/lib/libqt.so.2 .
\endcode

</ul>

To develop with Qt 1.4x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-1.44
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

To develop with Qt 2.x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.1.0
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

Setting the \c PATH ensures that the proper version of moc is being
used.  Your \c Makefile should refer to \c ${QTDIR}/include and \c
${QTDIR}/lib to include the proper header files and link with the
proper libraries.

</ul>

<h1 align=center>How-To Report A Bug</h1>

<p>If you think you have found a bug in Qt, we would like to hear
about it so we can fix it.

<p>Before reporting a bug, please check the <a
href="http://www.troll.no/faq/">FAQs</a> and <a
href="http://www.troll.no/platforms/">Platform Notes</a> on our web
site to see if the issue is already known.

<p>Always include the following information in your bug report:
<nl>
<li>The name and version number of your compiler
<li>The name and version number of your operating system
<li>The version of Qt you are using, and what configure options it was compiled with.
</nl>

<p>If the problem you are reporting is only visible run-time, try to
include a small test program that shows the problem when run. Often,
such a program can be made by simply doing some minor changes to one
of the many example programs in the <tt>qt/examples</tt> directory.

<p>Please send the bug report to <a

<title>Books about GUI</title>

<h1 align=center>Books about GUI</h1><br clear="all">

<p>This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying.  This is just a few GUI/UI books that don't gather
dust in our shelves.

<p><b>Programming with Qt</b> by Kalle Dalheimer, ISBN 1-56592-588-2
is a simple introduction to programming with Qt.  For those wanting
something more than our short tutorial, this is it.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565925882/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>The (Psychology|Design) of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.

<p>The title of the first edition was <em>The Psychology of Everyday
Things</em>, the book was renamed to <em>The Design of Everyday
Things</em> for the second edition, sacrificing a neat acronym for a
descriptive title.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385267746/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><a name="fowler"></a><b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler,
ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other
user interface elements, with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each
chapter covers one widget or other element, contains the most
important recommendation from the Macintosh, Windows and Motif style
guides, notes about common problems, comparison with other widgets
that can serve some of the same roles as this one, etc.

<p>There is an <a href="http://fast-consulting.com/chkbox.htm">example
chapter</a> on the author's web site.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070592748/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the <em>don't</em>s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to <em>do</em> helps, too.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201622165/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

This book is now available
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/HIGuidelines/HIGuidelines-2.html">
on the web</a> and there is a
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/HIGOS8Guide/thig-2.html">Mac
OS 8 addendum.</a>

<p><b>The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design</b>, ISBN
1-55615-679-0, is perhaps the best guide to how a modern GUI program
should look.  Skips some of the more elementary stuff from the
Macintosh one, but covers newer widgets (like tool tips) and says much
about e.g. dialog layout.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556156790/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p>This book too is available on the web, but has occasionally been
hidden in an impenetrable maze of javascript.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/userexperience/">Try and see.</a>

<p><b>The Icon Book</b> by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is a
perhaps the only thorough coverage of icons and icon use in software.
In order for icons to be successful, people must be able to do four
things with them: decode, recognize, find and activate them.  This
book explains these goals from scratch and how to reach them, both
with single icons and icon families.  Some 500 examples are scattered
throughout the text, generally in groups of four or five.

<h1 align="center">The Twelve Networking Truths</h1>

<p>This is <a href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/1/in-notes/rfc">RFC
1925</a> - copied in here since its truths are even less limited than
the author says.  5, 6, 6a and 7 in particular can often be quoted
during software development discussions.

<h3>Status of this Memo</h3>

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

   This memo documents the fundamental truths of networking for the
   Internet community. This memo does not specify a standard, except in
   the sense that all standards must implicitly follow the fundamental
   truths.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

   The truths described in this memo result from extensive study over an
   extended period of time by many people, some of whom did not intend
   to contribute to this work. The editor merely has collected these
   truths, and would like to thank the networking community for
   originally illuminating these truths.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
   fundamental truths underlying all networking. These truths apply to
   networking in general, and are not limited to TCP/IP, the Internet,
   or any other subset of the networking community.

<h3>2. The Fundamental Truths</h3>

   <ol>
   <li> It Has To Work.

   <li> No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,
        you can't increase the speed of light.

	<ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you
	can't make a baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed
	this up <em>might</em> make it slower, but it won't make it
	happen any quicker. </ol>

   <li> With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
        not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
        are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
        as they fly overhead.

   <li> Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
        networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
        builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
        network.

   <li> It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate problems
        into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
        this is a bad idea.

   <li> It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving
        the problem to a different part of the overall network
        architecture) than it is to solve it.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). It is always possible to add
        another level of indirection. </ol>

   <li> It is always something.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two
        (you can't have all three). </ol>

   <li> It is more complicated than you think.

   <li> For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.

       <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary) Every networking problem always
       takes longer to solve than it seems like it should.</ol>

   <li> One size never fits all.

   <li> Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and
        a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). See rule 6a. </ol>

   <li> In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there
        is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
        away.

   </ol>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

   This RFC raises no security issues. However, security protocols are
   subject to the fundamental networking truths.
