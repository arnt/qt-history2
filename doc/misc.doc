<h1 align="center">
Frequently Asked Questions
</h1><center>This documentation can be <a href="/dl/">downloaded</a> in full</center>
<ol>
<li>
What kind of licenses exist for Qt?
<p>
A: The Qt toolkit is available under two different licenses:
The professional license, and the free license for developing free
software for the X platform.	
<p>
<li>
What are the differences between the professional and free versions of Qt?
<p> 
A: You can write commercial software using the professional license.
The library itself is the same. You also get one year of free support
when you buy a professional license.
<p>
<li>
Will you continue to have a free license?
<p>
A: We will continue to release free versions for non-commercial use
on the X Window System.
<p>
<li>
Can I write software for internal use in my company/organization using
the free license?
<p>
A: That depends.  If you want to use the free license within an
organization, your software must be intended for the free software
community.  Your software must be usable outside your organization (if
anyone should want to use it) you must notify Troll Tech before
starting to use it, you have to allow free distribution and you have
to make your source code available.
<p>
<li>
Can I write software under the GNU General Public License, GNU
General Library Public License or BSD licenses using the Qt free license? 
<p>
A: Yes. 
<p>
<li>
Really? Your additional requirements seem to conflict with the GPL.
<p>
A: Really yes. We require cooperation from you, in return you can use
Qt. We could have demanded money (actually, we do for the professional
licence) and still not have been in conflict with the GPL.
<p>
<li>
I want to use Qt to develop free software on Windows. 
<p>
A: Qt is not free for Windows.  We do however sell professional licenses. 
<p>
<li>
When will 1.0 be released? 
<p>
A: This question seems not to be a FAQ any more, so we've removed the
answer.
<p>
<li>
I don't want to give away my source. What do I do? 
<p>
A: Then you need a  professional license. 
<p>
<li>
Can I charge for my application? 
<p>
A: If you have a professional license; of course. If you have a free
license your software must be freely distributable and you must
include the source.
<p>
The free license is intended for <em>free</em> software.  We realize
that CD-ROMs cost money to produce, for example, so you can charge a
copying fee.
<p>
<li>
Where can I find Qt?  
<p>
A: The latest version of Qt can be downloaded from http://www.troll.no
or from ftp.troll.no, or (less often updated) from sunsite.unc.edu
in /pub/Linux/X11/devel/ (or /pub/Linux/Incoming).
<p>
We encourage all developers of software that use Qt to upload
their work to ftp.troll.no.
<p>
<li>
Who is Troll Tech and what are your future plans?  
<p>
A: Troll Tech is a company based in Oslo, the capital of Norway. Our
business idea is to develop and market our multi-platform, superior
quality, GUI toolkit: Qt.
<p>
Troll Tech was founded in 1994. However, the core team of
designers at Troll Tech started developing Qt already in
1992. Ever since then, Qt has steadily expanded and improved. Qt is
currently used in hundreds of software development projects world wide.
<p>
In addition to Qt development and support, Troll Tech engages on a
consultancy basis in a large-scale software development project. The
project, which naturally is based on Qt, is run by the Norwegian
division of NCR (previously AT&T).
<p>
<li>
Can I use Qt's classes without writing a graphical user interface?  
<p>
A: Quite a few of the classes can be used independently of the user
interface. See utility classes, There are also a few classes that
will work without the GUI only by chance.
<p>
<li>
I want to port Qt to a new platform.  What do I do? 
<p>
A: If the new platform is POSIX-like and runs the X Window System, it's
simple.  Read the file PORTING for details. If you succeed you can
send us the patches.  When we've added your patches to our source
tree, Qt will officially support the new platform.
<p>
<li>
Will Qt be available for [OS/2, Mac, Amiga]? 
<p>
A: At present, Qt only works well on X11 and Win32 (Windows 95 and
Windows NT).  Porting to other platforms is a lower priority.
Currently, we concentrate on the Windows and X versions.
<p>
<li>
Can I make a Qt shared library and distribute it with my Linux
distribution?
<p>
A: Yes, if you do not make changes to Qt and include all the files
present in our distribution of Qt.  (That is, you must include the
source code.)
<p>
<li>
Can I distribute dynamically linked applications that use Qt?
Can I distribute statically linked applications that use Qt? 
<p>
A: Yes and yes, as long as you do not modify Qt. 
<p>
<li>
I need to modify Qt.
<p>
A: Are you sure?  Inheritance is very often a better alternative.  If
you do change Qt, you may not distribute the modified toolkit or
programs using it.
<p>
We encourage you to send patches to qt-bugs@troll.no.  We will try
to evaluate the patches and reply as soon as they come in.  If we
like what we see, we'll incorporate it in the next Qt release.
<li>
Why can't I distribute modified versions of Qt?  I want to distribute
my application quickly, not wait for you to make a new Qt release.
<p>
A: Having several different shared libraries with the same name is not
a good idea.  Having five libraries, equal except for minor bugfixes,
in memory isn't a good idea either.  Finally, we don't want support
questions about libraries we have no knowledge of.
<p>
<li>
How can I distribute my cool widget library? 
<p>
A: In several ways.  Pick and choose. 
<p>
If the library is small, a widget or two, perhaps the best way is
to submit it as a contribution to Qt.
<p>
If it's larger, you can distribute it, and you can include Qt along
with it.  But you <em>cannot</em> include Qt <em>as part of</em> your
library (e.g. by making a shared library which includes Qt and your
library).
<p>
People must still be aware that they are using Qt, and they must
have a license for Qt.
<p>
This applies to wrapper libraries as well, of course.  If you write
Ada or Perl bindings, fine.  But anyone who uses your bindings must
also have a license for Qt.
<p>
<li>
I found this obscure bug and I need it fixed, fast! 
<p>
A: We sell support and maintenance contracts.  We try to support the
free users, and we take all bug reports seriously, no matter who
they come from.
<p>
But, of course, when there's too much to do we have to put more
emphasis on paying customers.
<p>
<li>
<p>
The Qt demos I've seen only have one window.  Can I have several
windows in one application?
<p>
A: Yes, easily.
<p>
<li>
Is there a mailing list or something for Qt?
<p>
A: There are two: qt-interest@troll.no and qt-announce.
<p>
Qt-interest is a user forum.  There can be as much as 20 messages per
week.  To join it, send a message containing the single word
"subscribe" to qt-interest-request@troll.no.
<p>
Qt-announce is for announcements of new Qt versions and a few other
announcements.  We expect that there will be less than ten messages to
the list each year.  To join the list, send mail containing the single
word "subscribe" to qt-announce-request@troll.no.
<p>
All messages to Qt-announce are also sent to Qt-interest, so you don't
need to be on both lists.
<p>
<li>
Do you have any plans for a graphical designer/dialog builder?
<p>
A: We are working on one now. There will be further announcements on 
qt-interest and, as appropriate, qt-announce.
<p>
There is also a free dialog editor written by Jeff Harris and Klaus
Ebner.  See
<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~jharris/dlgedit/">

information.

<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60"; URL="easteregg2.html">

<h1 align=center>Congratulations!</h1>
<h2>You've found our easter egg</h2>
<h6>No prizes, though</h6>
<p>
A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a Netscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
Netscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."

Amen!
