<title>Qt toolkit - overview</title>
</head><body>

This is the announcement of Qt 0.9, the first public beta version.

<h1>Qt announcement</h1>

Troll Tech is proud to relase a free beta-version of Qt (pronounced:
"cute") for X-Windows/Linux.

<p>

Qt is an object-oriented framework for developing graphical user interface
applications.

<p>

It is ftp'able from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/Incoming, hopefully
soon /pub/Linux/devel/c++, and from ftp.nvg.unit.no in /pub/linux/qt.

<p>

The documentation can be browsed on the web at <a href=http://www.troll.no/>
http://www.troll.no/</a> where you will also find other Qt-related links.

<p>

About Qt:

<p>

Qt consists of a rich C++ library (around 100 classes) and a meta-object
system that extends C++ with new concepts called signals and slots.
Signals and slots define clean and natural object interfaces for creating
independent objects.
This makes Qt very suitable for true component programming.

<p>

A "hello world" application under Qt is only 8 lines of C++ code:

<pre>
    #include &lt;qmsgbox.h&gt;
    #include &lt;qapp.h&gt;

    int main( int argc, char **argv )
    {
        QApplication a( argc, argv );
        return QMessageBox::message( "Attention", "Hello, world!" );
    }
</pre>

Qt dramatically cuts down on development time and complexity in
writing user interface software for X-Windows/Linux.
It allows the programmer to focus directly on the programming task,
and not mess around with low-level X11 code.

<p>

Qt is very fast and compact because it is based direcly on Xlib and not
Motif or X Intrinsics.
Qt's widgets (user interface objects) emulate Motif look and feel.

<p>

Qt supports advanced features such as drawing transformed graphics,
including drawing rotated text and pixmaps.
Pixmaps can be loaded and saved using several image formats.
An image class makes it easy to implement image processing algorithms.

<p>

Qt is definitely not a toy. It is a professional product that compares
well to any commercial GUI class library.

<p>

If you find any bugs, send a report to qt-bugs@troll.no.

<p>

If you create a nice Qt program and want us to distribute it as a
contribution to Qt, send us a line at info@troll.no.

<title>Qt toolkit - FAQ</title>
</head><body>
<h1>
Frequently Asked Questions
</h1>

Here is this week's top eleven Qt questions:
<ol>
<li>Q: Does there exist a FAQ for Qt? <p>
    A: This shouldn't be a FAQ any more, so naturally this answer won't be
       in the next version of the FAQ. <p>
<li>Q: Will Qt continue to be free? <p>
    A: We will continue to release binary versions for linux, and they will
       be free for non-commercial purposes.  The source, and other versions
       than for linux, will not be free. <p>
       The commercial versions of Qt will include the source code. <p>
<li>Q: What other versions of Qt exist/are planned? <p>
    A: We're working on versions for several other version of Unix, Windows
       and OS/2.  The other versions are not as complete as the linux version
       yet. <p>
<li>Q: When will v1.0 be released? <p>
    A: We plan to release 1.0 for linux on November 1st.  Other
       platforms will follow. <p>
<li>Q: Will v1.0 include... <p>
    A: v1.0 will not include resources or an interactive GUI designer.  It
       will include postscript output, geometry management and much more
       documentation. <p>
<li>Q: Who is Troll Tech and what are your future plans? <p>
    A: Troll Tech consists of three talented, hard-working programmers who
       work day and night to finish Qt, and enjoy it.  We started the
       company about a year ago, but parts of Qt were written for earlier
       projects.  The first line of code was written in 1992. <p>
       Most of our income comes from a contract with a beta customer;
       we develop code based on Qt for the Norwegian division of a small
       American company called AT&T. <p>
<li>Q: Can I use Qt's classes without writing a graphical user interface? <p>
    A: Quite a few of the classes can be used independently of the user
       interface.  See <a href=tools.html>utility classes,</a>  There are
       also a few classes that will work without the GUI only by chance. <p>
<li>Q: I have (linker, compiler) errors. <p>
    A: gcc 2.5.8 will not work with Qt.  You need libc 4.6.27 at the
       very least, 4.7 is recommended.  We use gcc 2.6.2, 2.6.3 and
       2.7.0; all work. <p>
       If you use gcc 2.6, binutils 2.5.2.6 is recommended.  If you use
       gcc 2.7, binutils 2.5.2l.17 or later is recommended. <p>
       The a.out library in Qt 0.91b will only work with
       gcc 2.6/binutils 2.5.2.6; we will provide an a.out library for
       gcc 2.7/binutils 2.5.2l.17 on request. <p>
<li>Q: Where can I find Qt? <p>
    A: The latest version of Qt can be downloaded from <a
        href=ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/linux/qt>ftp.nvg.unit.no in
	/pub/linux/qt</a> or (less often updated) from <a
	href=ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/c++>sunsite.unc.edu
	in /pub/Linux/devel/c++	(or /pub/Linux/Incoming).</a>

<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60; URL=easteregg2.html">

<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
<h2>You've found our easter egg</h2>
<h6>No prizes, though</h6>
<p>
A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a Netscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
Netscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."
</blockquote>
Amen!
