This is the free software license for Qt version 1.30; it mainly
covers development of free software for the free software community.

noticeably.  (<a href="mailto:info@troll.no">Write to us</a> if you
feel hampered, and we may be able to do something about it.)
<p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.troll.no/pricing.html">professional</a> license

<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60"; URL="easteregg2.html">
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h1 align=center>Congratulations!</h1>
<h2>You've found our easter egg</h2>
<h6>No prizes, though</h6>
<p>
A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a N*tscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
N*tscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."
</blockquote>
Amen!
