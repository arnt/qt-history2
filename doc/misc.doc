<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60"; URL="easteregg2.html">
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<center><h1>Congratulations!<br>
You've found our oldest easter egg</h1><br clear="all">
<p><small>No prizes, though</small>
</center>

<p>A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery hierarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a N*tscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
N*tscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."

Amen!

<h1 align=center>Books about GUI</h1><br clear="all">

<p>This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying.  This is just a few GUI/UI books that don't gather
dust in our shelves.

<p><b>Programming with Qt</b> by Kalle Dalheimer, ISBN 1-56592-588-2
is a simple introduction to programming with Qt.  For those wanting
something more than our short tutorial, this is it.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565925882/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>The (Psychology|Design) of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.

<p>The title of the first edition was <em>The Psychology of Everyday
Things</em>, the book was renamed to <em>The Design of Everyday
Things</em> for the second edition, sacrificing a neat acronym for a
descriptive title.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385267746/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><a name="fowler"></a><b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler,
ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other
user interface elements, with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each
chapter covers one widget or other element, contains the most
important recommendation from the Macintosh, Windows and Motif style
guides, notes about common problems, comparison with other widgets
that can serve some of the same roles as this one, etc.

<p>There is an <a href="http://fast-consulting.com/chkbox.htm">example
chapter</a> on the author's web site.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070592748/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the <em>don't</em>s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to <em>do</em> helps, too.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201622165/trolltech/t">

This book is now available
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/HIGuidelines/HIGuidelines-2.html">
on the web</a> and there is a
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/HIGOS8Guide/thig-2.html">Mac
OS 8 addendum.</a>

<p><b>The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design</b>, ISBN
1-55615-679-0, is perhaps the best guide to how a modern GUI program
should look.  Skips some of the more elementary stuff from the
Macintosh one, but covers newer widgets (like tool tips) and says much
about e.g. dialog layout.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556156790/trolltech/t">

<p>This book too is available on the web, but has occasionally been
hidden in an impenetrable maze of javascript.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/userexperience/">Try and see.</a>

<p><b>The Icon Book</b> by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is a
perhaps the only thorough coverage of icons and icon use in software.
In order for icons to be successful, people must be able to do four
things with them: decode, recognize, find and activate them.  This
book explains these goals from scratch and how to reach them, both
with single icons and icon families.  Some 500 examples are scattered
throughout the text, generally in groups of four or five.

<h3>Status of this Memo</h3>

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

   This memo documents the fundamental truths of networking for the
   Internet community. This memo does not specify a standard, except in
   the sense that all standards must implicitly follow the fundamental
   truths.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

   The truths described in this memo result from extensive study over an
   extended period of time by many people, some of whom did not intend
   to contribute to this work. The editor merely has collected these
   truths, and would like to thank the networking community for
   originally illuminating these truths.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
   fundamental truths underlying all networking. These truths apply to
   networking in general, and are not limited to TCP/IP, the Internet,
   or any other subset of the networking community.

<h3>2. The Fundamental Truths</h3>

   <ol>
   <li> It Has To Work.

   <li> No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,
        you can't increase the speed of light.

	<ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you
	can't make a baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed
	this up *might* make it slower, but it won't make it happen
	any quicker. </ol>

   <li> With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
        not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
        are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
        as they fly overhead.

   <li> Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
        networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
        builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
        network.

   <li> It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate problems
        into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
        this is a bad idea.

   <li> It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving
        the problem to a different part of the overall network
        architecture) than it is to solve it.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). It is always possible to add
        another level of indirection. </ol>

   <li> It is always something

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two
        (you can't have all three). </ol>

   <li> It is more complicated than you think.

   <li> For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.

       <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary) Every networking problem always
       takes longer to solve than it seems like it should.</ol>

   <li> One size never fits all.

   <li> Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and
        a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). See rule 6a. </ol>

   <li> In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there
        is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
        away.

   </ol>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

   This RFC raises no security issues. However, security protocols are
   subject to the fundamental networking truths.

   The references have been deleted in order to protect the guilty and
   avoid enriching the lawyers.
