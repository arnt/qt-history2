\title About Qt

<p>Qt is a cross-platform C++ GUI application framework. It provides
application developers with all the functionality needed to build
state-of-the-art graphical user interfaces. Qt is fully
object-oriented, easily extensible, and allows true component
programming.

<p>
Since the commercial introduction of Qt in early
1996, Qt has formed the basis of many hundreds of successful
applications worldwide. Qt is also the basis of the popular
<a href=http://www.kde.org/>KDE</a> Linux
desktop environment, a standard component of all major Linux distributions.

<p>
Qt is supported on the following platforms:
<ul>
 <li><b>MS/Windows</b> - 95, 98, NT, and 2000
 <li><b>Unix/X11</b> - Linux, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Digital Unix,
	    IBM AIX, SGI IRIX and a wide range of others
 <li><b>Embedded</b> - Linux platforms with framebuffer support.
</ul>

<p>
Qt is a product of <a href="troll.html">Troll Tech</a>.

<p>
Qt is released under two different licenses:

<dl>
<dd><b>Qt Professional Edition</b> is provided for commercial
software development. It permits traditional commercial software
distribution and includes free upgrades and Technical Support
Service. For the latest prices, please see the Troll Tech web site, <a

\title Common Problems

<h2>Link error, complaining about a lack of \c vtbl, \c _vtbl, \c
__vtbl or similar </h2>

This indicates that you include the Q_OBJECT macro in a class declaration
and probably also run the moc, but forget to link the moc-generated object
code into your executable. Read <a href="moc.html">Using the Meta Object
Compiler</a> for details on how to use moc.

<h2>Using different versions of Qt on the same machine</h2>

Qt programs need the following components of the Qt distribution: <dl>

<dt><b>Header files - Compile time</b>

<dd>Programmers need to include the Qt header files. Those with a
command-line compiler will typically use options such as \c
/I%QTDIR%\include or \c -I${QTDIR}/include.  They will need the header
files of the version of Qt they wish to build programs with.  The
header files are in the \c include subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<dt><b>Meta Object Compiler - Compile time</b>

<dd>Programmers need to run the Meta Object Compiler - \e moc.  The moc is
found in the \c bin subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<dt><b>Static or shared libraries - Link time</b>

<dd>Programmers need to link with static or shared libraries. Those with a
command-line compiler will typically use options such as \c
/L%QTDIR%\lib\qt.lib or \c -L${QTDIR}/lib \c -lqt.  They will need the
libraries of the version of Qt they wish to build programs with.  The
libraries are in the \c lib subdirectory of Qt distributions.

<dt><b>Shared libraries - Run time</b>

<dd>Users of programs built with the shared Qt libraries need these same
shared libraries to run the programs.  The libraries are in the \c lib
subdirectory of Qt distributions.  Shared libraries are made available
to programs in places such as \c C:\windows\system on Windows
platforms, directories listed in file \c /etc/ld.so.conf on Linux,
standard \c lib directories on Unix, or the directories listed in the
environment variable \c ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} on Unix/Linux.

</dl>

Binary packages usually consist of two parts:

<ul>
<li>run time libraries in the run time package, usually called
\c qt2.

<li>header files, the moc and static libraries in the developers' kit,
usually called \c qt2-dev.

</ul>

Depending on how you are using Qt, you need to make specific parts of
the Qt distribution available to your programs.  Typical situations are
described below.<dl>

<dt><b>Developers building for a single version of Qt on Unix
- Qt packages</b>

<dd>You build programs with a single version of Qt, but you still need
to run programs linked with another version of Qt.  You are typically
a Linux developer who builds programs for Qt 2.x on a KDE desktop based
on Qt 1.4x.  Qt packages are usually split into a shared library
package with a name like \c qt and a developer package with a name
like \c qt-dev.  You will need the appropriate packages:

<ul>

<li>To build programs you will need the header files, the moc and the
libraries of Qt 2.x. They are included in the developer package of
Qt 2.x (\c qt2-dev or the like).

<li>To run programs you will need the shared libraries of Qt 2.x
and Qt 1.4x. They are included in the regular packages
of Qt 2.x (\c qt2 or the like) and Qt 1.4x (\c qt1
or the like).

</ul>Just install those 3 packages. You may need to set the
environment variable \c QTDIR.

<dt><b>Developers building for two versions of Qt on Unix
- Qt sources</b>

<dd>You build and run programs for Qt v1.4x and Qt 2.x. You will need:<ul>

<li>the \e header \e files, the \e moc and the \e libraries of Qt 2.x
and Qt 1.4x to build programs,

<li>the shared libraries of Qt 2.x and Qt 1.4x to run programs (if you
use shared linking).

</ul>

Get source distributions of both Qt 1.4x and Qt 2.x. <ol>

<li>Install and build Qt 1.4x and Qt 2.x, usually in \c /opt or
\c /usr/local. In the case of \c /opt:

\code
$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c qt-1.44.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-1.44
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-1.44
$ configure [options]
$ make

$ cd /opt
$ gunzip -c qt-2.1.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd qt-2.1.0
$ setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.1.0
$ configure [options]
$ make
\endcode

<li>Make shared libraries available to programs at run time. Either
add both \c /opt/qt-1.44 and \c /opt/qt-2.0.1 to your environment
variable \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH or make links to the libraries in a
standard directory like \c /usr/local/lib:

\code
cd /usr/local/lib
ln -s /opt/qt-1.44/lib/libqt.so.1 .
ln -s /opt/qt-2.1.0/lib/libqt.so.2 .
\endcode

</ol>

To develop with Qt 1.4x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-1.44
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

To develop with Qt 2.x use:

\code
setenv QTDIR /opt/qt-2.1.0
setenv PATH ${QTDIR}/bin:${PATH}
\endcode

Setting the \c PATH ensures that the proper version of moc is being
used.  Your \c Makefile should refer to \c ${QTDIR}/include and \c
${QTDIR}/lib to include the proper header files and link with the
proper libraries.

</dl>

<h2>Using Qt on X11 without a window manager</h2>

When using Qt without a window manager on Unix/X11, you will very
likely experience focus problems. Without a window manager, there is
no focus handling on X11, and no concept of an active window
either. If you want your application to work in such an environment,
you have to explicitly mark a window as active \e after showing it:

\code
 yourWindow->show();
 yourWindow->setActiveWindow();
\endcode

Note that setActiveWindow() won't work if the widget does not become
phyiscally visible during this event cycle. However, without a window
manager running, this is guaranteed to happen. For the curious reader:
setActiveWindow() emulates a window manager by explicitly setting the
X Input Focus to a widget's toplevel window.

\title Key Features in Qt 2.1

As usual, large sections of the documentation have been revised and
lots of new documentation has been added.

<p>Much work went into existing classes, based on all the feedback we got
from our users.  A warm thank you to you all at this point, we
honestly hope to satisfy most of your wishes with the new release.

<p>Among the things that got a lot of polishing is the new geometry
management system that was introduced with the 2.x series.  Some
classes, such as QBoxLayout, have been rewritten and many size hints
and size policies were optimized.  As usual with newly introduced
systems, the occasional bug has been fixed as well.  As a result,
layout in Qt-2.1 is not only nicer but also faster.

<p>Big parts of the file dialog have been rewritten.  It is now
synchronized in terms of features with the common Windows dialog,
including fancy drag'n'drop and inplace renaming.  You can customize
both parts of the dialog, the frontend with info and preview widgets,
the backend with different network protocols (see the QFileDialog and
QNetworkProtocol documentation for details).

<p>Especially interesting for dynamic Qt applications is the newly
introduced property system.  Many interesting things, from scripting
up to graphical user interface builders, become easier.  The
technology requires a new macro Q_PROPERTY and a new revision of Qt's
meta object compiler (moc).  See the Qt documentation for details.

<p>Due to strong customer demand, we added a cross-platform way to easily
implement multidocument interfaces (known as 'MDI').  The widget is
called QWorkspace and makes this task trivial.

<p>On X11, text dropping from Motif drag'n'drop applications has been
added, to make your Qt applications inter-operable with those Motif
applications that survived Y2K.

<p>The rich text system, first introduced in Qt 2.0, has been revised.
Apart from great speed improvements, it now supports HTML tables as
well as floating images.

<p>QMultiLineEdit, the text input field in Qt, got the missing word wrap
functionality.  It's probably the last big extension we will add to
that widget.  In Qt 3.0, it will be replaced by a fancier, faster and
more powerful QTextEdit widget that also deals with different colors
and fonts in a way similar to the existing QTextView.

<p>Qt follows the respective GUI style guides even more closely.  This
includes honouring desktop settings, and keyboard shortcuts such as
Ctrl-Z/Y for undo/redo in line edit and multi-line edit controls.
Dialog handling for both modal and non-modal dialogs has been improved
to follow the platform conventions precisely.

<p>With QIconView, we added a powerful new visualization widget similar
to QListView and QListBox.  It contains optinally labelled pixmap
items that the user can select, drag around, rename, delete and more.

<p>Compared to the previous release, we have managed to reduce overall
memory consumption while improving execution speed and features.

\title Change Notes for Qt 2.1

<h2>New major features in existing classes</h2>
<ul>

<li>QApplication	- new function wakeUpGuiThread() to simplify using threads
		  with Qt.

<li>QArray		- added sorting and binary search.

<li>QColor		- custom color support added.  qRgb(r,g,b) helper function
		  now sets an opaque alpha value instead of a transparent
		  one.

<li>QComboBox	- support for text items with icons.

<li>QFileDialog	- many new features including fancy drag'n'drop
		  and inplace renaming.
		  Methods like setInfoPreviewWidget()and
		  setContentsPreviewWidget() make it easy to customize
		  the dialog extensively. With QUrlOperator and the
		  QNetworkProtocol abstraction, the dialog can operate
		  transparently by various different network protocols,
		  such as HTTP and FTP (see the Network Extension).

<li>QFocusEvent	- carries a reason() for the event. Possible reasons are
		  Mouse, Tab, ActiveWindow, ShortCut and other. The
		  addition makes line edit controls behave properly.

<li>QHeader		- added optional visual sort indicator. Revisited API that 
		  operates on sections only (solves the 'logical' vs. 'actual' 
		  index confusion). A reworked 'table' example shows how
		  to use QHeader in combination with a scrollview to create
		  a simple spreadsheet.

<li>QListBox	- many signals and functions added for convenience and
		  greater flexibility.

<li>QListView	- various selections modes similar to QListBox, many
		  new functions and signals added for convenience and
		  greater flexibility.

<li>QMainWindow	- implemented draggable and hidable toolbars. A menubar
		  can be made draggable by simply putting it in a toolbar.

<li>QMetaObject	- Parts of the API made public. The meta object allows
		  applications to access information about an object's
		  properties as well as its signals and slots.

<li>QMultiLineEdit	- added different word wrap modes: WidgetWidth,
		  FixedPixelWidth and FixedColumnWidth.

<li>QObject		- property access functions property() and setProperty().

<li>QPen		- added adjustable cap and join styles.

<li>QPopupMenu	- added support for tear-off menus, custom items
		  and widget items.
		  A new function setItemParameter() makes it possible
		  to distinguish between several menu items connected to
		  one single slot.

<li>QPrinter        - Now allows printing to the default printer without doing
                  setup() first.

<li>QProgressDialog	- auto-reset and auto-close modes.

<li>QPushButton	- added a menu button mode with setPopup().

<li>QScrollView	- support for auto-scrolling on drag move events (drag
		  auto scroll mode).

<li>QSignal		- optional additional integer parameter for the emitted
		  signal.

<li>QSimpleRichText - added adjustSize() function that implements a clever
		  size hint. Vertical break support for printing. inText()
		  hit test.

<li>QSpinBox	- different button symbols, currently UpDownArrows and
		  PlusMinus.

<li>QSplitter	- supports three resize modes now, Stretch, KeepSize
		  and FollowSizeHint.

<li>QString		- new functions setUnicode(), setUnicodeCodes(), setLatin1(),
		  startsWith() and endsWith()

<li>QStringList	- new functions fromStrList(), split(), join() and grep().

<li>QStyle		- some extensions for menu button indicators, default
		  button indicators, variable scrollbar extends and toolbar
		  handles.

<li>QStyleSheet	- a couple of tags added to the default sheet, such as
		  U, NOBR, HEAD, DL, DT, DD and table support (TABLE, TR,
		  TD, TH). Many attributes added to existing tags.

<li>QTextView	- basic table support. Contents is selectable, selections
		  can be pasted/dragged into other widgets.

<li>QToolBar	- stretchable depending on the orientation (setHorizontalStretchable()
		  and setVerticalStretchable(). Added orientationChanged() signal.

<li>QToolButton	- added optional delayed menu with setPopup() and
		  setPopupDelay(). Auto-raise behaviour adjustable.

<li>QWidget		- new widget flag WStyle_ContextHelp that adds a
		  context-help button to the window titlebar. The
		  button triggers "What's This?"-help. The flag works
		  with MS-Windows and future versions of X11 desktops
		  such as KDE-2.0.
		  New function showFullScreen().
		  Enabling and disabling with setEnabled() propagates to
		  children.
		  Changed isVisible(). It now returns whether a widget
		  is mapped up to the toplevel widget (the previous
		  implementation only returned isVisibleTo(parentWidget()).
		  New property 'backgroundOrigin' that lets a widget draw 
		  its background relatively to its parent widget's coordinate
		  system. This makes pseudo-transparency possible, without
		  the overhead of a real widget mask.
</ul>
<h2>New Classes</h2>
<ul>
<li>QCustomMenuItem	- an abstract base class for custom menu items in
		  popup menus.

<li>QFontDataBase	- provides information about the available fonts. Not really
		  a new class (it was used internally for the QFontDialog),
		  but for the first time public API.

<li>QGuardedPtr	- a template class that provides guarded pointers to
		  QObjects.

<li>QIconView	- a sophisticated new widget similar to QListView and
		  QListBox.  An iconview contains optinally labelled pixmap
		  items that the user can select, drag around, rename, delete
		  and more. The widget is highly optimized for speed and
		  large amounts of icons.

<li>QInputDialog	- a convenience dialog to get some simple input values from
		  the user.

<li>QMetaProperty	- stores meta data about properties. Part of the meta
		  object system.

<li>QNetworkProtocol- base class for network protocols, provides
		  a common API for network protocols.

<li>QUrl/
QUrlOperator	- provides an easy way to work with URLs.

<li>QVariant	- a tagged union for the most common Qt data types.

<li>QValueStack	- a value-based stack container.

<li>QWorkspace	- provides a workspace that can contain decorated
		  windows as opposed to frameless child widgets.
		  QWorkspace makes it easy to implement a multidocument
		  interface (MDI).

<li>QBig5Codec	- provides support for the Big5 Chinese encoding.
</ul>

<h2> Changes which may affect runtime behaviour </h2>

<ul>
<li>QDataStream / QPicture
 To accomodate for improved functionality, the stream serialization format
 of QString and QPen has changed in Qt 2.1. The format version
 number has been increased to 3. Compatibility has been kept, so
 applications built with this version of Qt are automatically able to read
 QDataStream and QPicture data generated by earlier Qt 2.x versions. But if
 your application needs to generate data that must be readable by
 applications that are compiled with earlier versions of Qt, you must use
 QDataStream::setVersion() (if the data contains QString or QPen objects).
 See the documentation of this function for further discussion.

<li>QPainter::drawPolygon()
 An outline is no longer drawn in the brush color if NoPen is specified.
 This matches the behaviour on Windows and ensures that the area
 painted in this case is the same pixels defined by a QRegion made
 from the polygon.  To get the old behaviour, you can call
 painter.setPen(painter.brush()) prior to painting, which will also
 work on Windows.

<li>QPushButton::sizeHint()
 The size hint of auto-default push buttons has been slightly
 increased in order to reserve space for a default button indicator
 frame. This is necessary for a proper Motif or Platinum emulation. If
 this change destroys your geometry management, a auto-default button
 is probably not what you wanted anyway. Simply call
 setAutoDefault(FALSE) on these push buttons to get the old behaviour.

<li>QWidget
 Font and palette propagation has changed totally (from "almost
 braindead" to working).  In practice, the only changes we've seen are
 to the better.

<li>QColor
 qRgb(r,g,b) now sets a default opaque alpha value of 0xff instead of
 a transparent 0x00 alpha value formerly.  Use qRgb(r,g,b,a) if you do
 need a transparent alpha value.

<li>QPalette
 It turned out that the old normal/active/disabled set of color groups
 didn't work very well, except in the simplest hello-world examples,
 that it couldn't be fixed without nasty hacks, and that during five
 years nobody had discovered the bugs.  So, we've dropped our broken
 attempt at Tcl/Tk L&F compatibility, and added support for Windows
 2000 and Macintosh L&F compatitibility instead.  The Macintosh and
 Windows 2000 looks differentiate between the window with focus and
 other windows.  Qt calls the color groups QPalette::active() and
 QPalette::inactive() respectively.

<li>QGridLayout/QBoxLayout 
 setMargin() now also works on child layouts. As a result of this
 change, the geometry() of a layout now includes margin(). This may
 effect programs that use QLayout::geometry().

<li>QToolButton
 The now adjustable auto-raise behaviour defaults to TRUE only when
 a button is used inside a QToolBar. That's usually what you want. If not,
 call setAutoRaise(FALSE).
</ul>

\title Books about GUI

<p>This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying.  This is just a few GUI/UI books that don't gather
dust in our shelves.

<p><b>Programming with Qt</b> by Kalle Dalheimer, ISBN 1-56592-588-2
is a simple introduction to programming with Qt.  For those wanting
something more than our short tutorial, this is it.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565925882/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>The Design of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385267746/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><a name="fowler"></a><b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler,
ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other
user interface elements, with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each
chapter covers one widget or other element, contains the most
important recommendation from the Macintosh, Windows and Motif style
guides, notes about common problems, comparison with other widgets
that can serve some of the same roles as this one, etc.

<p>There is an <a href="http://fast-consulting.com/chkbox.htm">example
chapter</a> on the author's web site.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070592748/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the <em>don't</em>s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to <em>do</em> helps, too.

OS 8 addendum.</a>

<p><b>The Microsoft Windows User Experience</b>, ISBN 1-55615-679-0,
is Microsoft's look and feel bible.  Indispensable for everyone who
has customers that worship Microsoft, and it's quite good, too.

<p>Microsoft's guidelines are often available on the web, but have
occasionally been hidden in an impenetrable maze of javascript.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/userexperience/">Try and see.</a>

<p><b>The Icon Book</b> by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is a
perhaps the only thorough coverage of icons and icon use in software.
In order for icons to be successful, people must be able to do four
things with them: decode, recognize, find and activate them.  This
book explains these goals from scratch and how to reach them, both
with single icons and icon families.  Some 500 examples are scattered
throughout the text, generally in groups of four or five.

<h3>Status of this Memo</h3>

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

   This memo documents the fundamental truths of networking for the
   Internet community. This memo does not specify a standard, except in
   the sense that all standards must implicitly follow the fundamental
   truths.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

   The truths described in this memo result from extensive study over an
   extended period of time by many people, some of whom did not intend
   to contribute to this work. The editor merely has collected these
   truths, and would like to thank the networking community for
   originally illuminating these truths.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
   fundamental truths underlying all networking. These truths apply to
   networking in general, and are not limited to TCP/IP, the Internet,
   or any other subset of the networking community.

<h3>2. The Fundamental Truths</h3>

   <ol>
   <li> It Has To Work.

   <li> No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,
        you can't increase the speed of light.

	<ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you
	can't make a baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed
	this up <em>might</em> make it slower, but it won't make it
	happen any quicker. </ol>

   <li> With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
        not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
        are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
        as they fly overhead.

   <li> Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
        networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
        builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
        network.

   <li> It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate problems
        into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
        this is a bad idea.

   <li> It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving
        the problem to a different part of the overall network
        architecture) than it is to solve it.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). It is always possible to add
        another level of indirection. </ol>

   <li> It is always something.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two
        (you can't have all three). </ol>

   <li> It is more complicated than you think.

   <li> For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.

       <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary) Every networking problem always
       takes longer to solve than it seems like it should.</ol>

   <li> One size never fits all.

   <li> Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and
        a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.

        <ol type="a"> <li> (corollary). See rule 6a. </ol>

   <li> In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there
        is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
        away.

   </ol>

   This RFC raises no security issues. However, security protocols are
   subject to the fundamental networking truths.

\title Window Geometry

<h2> Overview</h2>

QWidget provides several functions that deal with a widget's
geometry.  Some of these functions operate on the pure client area
(i.e. the window excluding the window frame), others include the
window frame. The differentiation is done in a way that covers the
most common usage transparently.

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Including the window frame:</strong>
  <dd>x(), y(), frameGeometry(), pos() and move()
  <dt><strong>Excluding the window frame:</strong>
  <dd> geometry(), width(), height(), rect() and size()
</dl>

Note that the distinction only matters for decorated top-level
widgets. For all child widgets, the frame geometry is equal to the
widget's client geometry.

This image shows most of the functions in use:
<center><img src="geometry.png" alt="Illustrating image"></center>

<h2> Unix/X11 peculiarities </h2>

On Unix/X11, a window does not have a frame until the window manager
decorates it. This happens asychronously at some point in time after
calling show() and the first paint event the window receives - or it
does not happen at all. Keep in mind that X11 is policy-free (others
call it flexible). Thus you cannot make any safe assumption about the
decoration frame your window will get. Basic rule: There's always one
user who uses a window manager that breaks your assumption, and who
will complain to you.

Furthermore, a toolkit cannot simply place windows on the screen. All
Qt can do is to send certain hints to the window manager. The window
manager, a separate process, may either obey, ignore or missunderstand
them. Due to the partially unclear Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual (ICCCM), window placement is handled quite
differently in existing window managers.

X11 provides no standard or easy way to get the frame geometry once
the window got decorated. Qt solves this problem with nifty heuristics
and clever code that works on a wide range of window managers that
exist today. Don't be surprised if you find one where frameGeometry()
returns bogus results, though.

X11 also does not provide a way to maximize a window. The
showMaximized() function in Qt therefore has to emulate the
feature. Its result depends totally on the result of frameGeometry()
and the capability of the window manager to do proper window
placement, both of which cannot be guaranteed.

<h2>Restoring a Window's Geometry</h2>

A common task in modern applications is to restore a window's geometry
in a later session. On Windows, this is basically storing the result
of geometry() and calling setGeometry() in the next session before
doing show(). On X11, this won't work because an invisible window
doesn't have a frame yet. The window manager would decorate the window
later. When this happens, the window shifts towards the bottom/right
corner of the screen depending on the size of the decoration frame. X
theoretically provides a way to avoid this shift. Our tests have
shown, though, that almost all window managers fail to implement this
feature.

 A workaround is to call setGeometry() after show(). This has the
 two disadvantages that the widget appears at a wrong place for a
 millisecond (results in flashing) and that currently only every
 second window manager gets it right. A safer solution is to store
 both pos() and size() and to restore the geometry using resize() and
 move() before calling show(), as demonstrated in the following
 example:

\code
	MyWidget* widget = new MyWidget
	...
	QPoint p = widget->pos();	// store position
	QSize s = widget->size();	// store size
	...
	widget = new MyWidget;
	widget->resize( s ); 	// restore size
	widget->move( p ); 	// restore position
	widget->show();		// show widget
\endcode

This method works on both MS-Windows and most existing X11 window
managers.
