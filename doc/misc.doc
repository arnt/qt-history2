<title>Qt toolkit - FAQ</title>
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h1 align="center">
Frequently Asked Questions
</h1>
<ol>

<li>
<em> Who is Troll Tech?  </em>
<p>
Troll Tech is a company based in Oslo, the capital of Norway. Our
business idea is to develop and market our multi-platform, superior
quality, GUI toolkit: Qt.
<p>
Troll Tech AS was founded in 1994. However, the core team of
designers at Troll Tech started developing Qt already in
1992. Ever since then, Qt has steadily expanded and improved. Qt is
currently used in hundreds of software development projects world wide.
<p>
In addition to Qt development and support, Troll Tech engages on a
consultancy basis in a large-scale software development project. The
project, which naturally is based on Qt, is run by the Norwegian
division of NCR (previously AT&T).
<p>

<li>
<em>Do you have any plans for a graphical designer/dialog builder?</em>
<p>
We are working on one now. There will be further announcements on 
qt-interest and, as appropriate, qt-announce.
<p>
There is also a free dialog editor written by Jeff Harris and Klaus
Ebner.  See
<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~jharris/dlgedit/">
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~jharris/dlgedit/</a> for more
information.
<p>

<li>
<em>Is there a mailing list or something for Qt?</em>
<p>
There are two: qt-interest@troll.no and qt-announce.
<p>
Qt-interest is a user forum.  There can be as much as 20 messages per
week.  To join it, send a message containing the single word
"subscribe" to qt-interest-request@troll.no.
<p>
Qt-announce is for announcements of new Qt versions and a few other
announcements.  We expect that there will be less than ten messages to
the list each year.  To join the list, send mail containing the single
word "subscribe" to qt-announce-request@troll.no.
<p>
All messages to Qt-announce are also sent to Qt-interest, so you don't
need to be on both lists.
<p>

<li>
<em>Can I use Qt's classes without writing a graphical user interface?  </em>
<p>
Quite a few of the classes can be used independently of the user
interface. See utility classes, for example. There are also a few
classes that will work without the GUI only by chance.
<p>

<li>
<em>What kind of licenses exist for Qt?</em>
<p>
The Qt toolkit is available under two different licenses: The
professional license for commercial use, and the free license for
developing free software for the X platform.
<p>

<li>
<em>What are the differences between the professional and free licenses of Qt?</em>
<p> 
You can write commercial software only if you have professional license(s).
The library itself is the same. You also get one year of free support
and upgrades when you buy professional license(s).
<p>

<li>
<em>Are you going to include so-and-so feature in Qt? If so, when?</em>
<p> 
We try not to make public speculations about the whats and whens of
the next Qt release too early, because we do not want to be known as a
vaporware company. Troll Tech is not Micro$oft.
<p>

<li>
<em>When will 1.0 be released? </em>
<p>
This question seems not to be a FAQ any more, so we've removed the
answer.
<p>

<li>
<em>I don't want to give away my source code. What do I do? </em>
<p>
Then you need professional license(s). 
<p>

<li>
<em>Can I charge for my application? </em>
<p>
If you have a professional license: Yes, of course. If you use the free
license your software must be freely distributable and you must
include the source.
<p>
The free license is intended for <em>free</em> software.  We realize
that CD-ROMs cost money to produce, for example, so you can charge a
copying fee.
<p>

<li>
<em>Where can I find Qt?  </em>
<p>
The latest version of Qt can be downloaded from http://www.troll.no
or from ftp.troll.no, and a whole range of ftp mirror sites around the
world. Look for a mirror near you on the list available under
http://www.troll.no/dl/
<p>
We encourage all developers of free Qt software to upload
their work to ftp.troll.no.
<p>

<li>
<em>I want to port Qt to a new platform.  What do I do? </em>
<p>
If the new platform is POSIX-like and runs the X Window System, it's
simple. Read the file PORTING for details. If you succeed you can
contact us at info@troll.no.
<p>

<li>
<em>Will Qt be available for [OS/2, Mac, Amiga]? </em>
<p>
At present, Qt only works well on X11 and Win32 (Windows 95 and
Windows NT).  Porting to other platforms is a lower priority.
Currently, we concentrate on the Windows and X versions.
<p>

<li> <em>Can I make a Qt shared library and distribute it with my
Linux distribution? </em> 
<p> 
Yes, if you do not make changes to Qt and include all the files
present in our distribution of Qt.  (That is, you must include the
source code.)  <p>

<li>
<em>Can I distribute dynamically linked applications that use Qt?  Can I
distribute statically linked applications that use Qt? </em>
<p>
Yes and yes. If you are using the free software license, you may
not modify Qt in either case.
<p>

<li>
<em>I found this obscure bug and I need it fixed, fast! </em>
<p>
We sell support and maintenance contracts.  We try to support the
developers using the free software license as well, and we take all
bug reports seriously, no matter who they come from. But, of course,
when there's too much to do, our customers have higher priority.
<p>

<li>
<em>The Qt demos I've seen only have one window.  Can I have several
windows in one application?</em>
<p>
Yes, easily.
<p>

</ol>

<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60"; URL="easteregg2.html">

<h1 align=center>Congratulations!</h1>
<h2>You've found our easter egg</h2>
<h6>No prizes, though</h6>
<p>
A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a Netscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
Netscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."
</blockquote>
Amen!
