This is the announcement of Qt 0.93, the fifth public beta version, with
minor updates.

<h1>The Qt Application Framework</h1>

Qt is a high-performance object-oriented framework for developing graphical
user interface (GUI) applications.

<p>

Qt can be downloaded from <a
href=http://www.troll.no/>http://www.troll.no/</a>, where you find
on-line documentation and other Qt-related pages, as well.

<p>

It is also ftp'able from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/Incoming, hopefully
soon /pub/Linux/X11/devel/, and from ftp.nvg.unit.no in /pub/linux/qt.

<p>

If you find any bugs, send a report to
<a href=mailto:qt-bugs@troll.no>qt-bugs@troll.no</a>

<p>

If you create a nice Qt program and want us to distribute it as a contrib,
send us a line at <a href=mailto:info@troll.no>info@troll.no</a>.

<p>

There is a mailing list for Qt users. Send a message containing the single
word "subscribe" to <a href=mailto:qt-interest-request@nvg.unit.no>
qt-interest-request@nvg.unit.no</a> to join the list.
You will receive a receipt from the list server within a few minutes.

<h1>
Frequently Asked Questions
</h1>

<ol>
<li>Q: Will Qt continue to be free? <p>
    A: We will continue to release binary versions for Linux, and they will
       be free for non-commercial purposes.  The source, and other versions
       than for Linux, will not be free. <p>
       The commercial versions of Qt will include the source code.
       Send a mail to sales@troll.no for pricing etc.<p>
<li>Q: What other versions of Qt exist/are planned? <p>
    A: We're working on versions for several other version of UNIX/X-Windows,
       Windows 95/NT and OS/2 Presentation Manager. <p>
       At the time of writing, only the Windows 95/NT, Solaris and HP-UX
       versions are as advanced as the Linux version. <p>
<li>Q: When will v1.0 be released? <p>
    A: We plan to release 1.0 for Linux in the summer of 1996. <p>
<li>Q: Will v1.0 include... <p>
    A: v1.0 will include more features such as geometry management,
       clipboard support, multi-line editor and improved documentation. <p>
<li>Q: Who is Troll Tech and what are your future plans? <p>
    A: Troll Tech consists of three (soon to be four) talented,
       hard-working programmers who
       work day and night to finish Qt, and enjoy it.  We started the
       company in 1993, but parts of Qt were written for earlier
       projects.  The first line of code was written in 1992. <p>
       Most of our income comes from a contract with a beta customer;
       we develop code based on Qt for the Norwegian division of a small
       company called AT&T. <p>
<li>Q: Can I use Qt's classes without writing a graphical user interface? <p>
    A: Quite a few of the classes can be used independently of the user
       interface.  See <a href=tools.html>utility classes,</a>  There are
       also a few classes that will work without the GUI only by chance. <p>
<li>Q: I have (linker, compiler) errors. <p>
    A: gcc 2.7.2 changes the size of the bool type from 4 to 1 bytes.  For
       the time being, we're staying with 2.7.0. <p>
<li>Q: Where can I find Qt? <p>
    A: The latest version of Qt can be downloaded
	<a href=http://www.troll.no/>on the web</a> or via from <a
        href=ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/linux/qt/>ftp.nvg.unit.no in
	/pub/linux/qt</a> or (less often updated) from <a
	href=ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/devel/>sunsite.unc.edu
	in /pub/Linux/X11/devel/ (or /pub/Linux/Incoming).</a> <p>

<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60; URL=easteregg2.html">

<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
<h2>You've found our easter egg</h2>
<h6>No prizes, though</h6>
<p>
A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a Netscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
Netscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."
</blockquote>
Amen!
