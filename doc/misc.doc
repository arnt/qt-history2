<title>Qt toolkit - FAQ</title>
</head><body>
<h1>
Frequently Asked Questions
</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Q: Will Qt continue to be free? <p>
    A: We will continue to release free versions for the X Window System,
and they will be free for non-commercial purposes. <p>

       Send a mail to <a href=mailto:sales@troll.no>sales@troll.no</a> for more information. <p>

<li>Q: What kind of licenses exist for Qt? <p>

    A: The Qt toolkit is available under several licenses; the free
license for X, a license for shareware developers for X and a
fully-fledged commercial license. <p>

<li>Q: What are the differences between the free and commercial versions of Qt?
 <p>
    A: You can write commercial software using the commercial license.
The library itself is the same. You also get 1 year of free support when
you buy a commercial license.<p>

<li>Q: Can I write software under the GNU General Public License, GNU
General Library Public License or BSD licenses using the Qt free license? <p>

    A: Yes. <p>

<li>Q: I want to use Qt to develop free software on Windows. <p>

    A: Qt is not free for Windows.  We do however sell commercial licenses. <p>

<li>Q: When will 1.0 be released? <p>

    A: 1.0 will be released in the summer of '96.  All the features that
are scheduled to go into 1.0 exist in-house already, there is only testing
and polishing left to do. <p>

<li>Q: I don't want to give away my source. What do I do? <p>

    A: Then you need a shareware or commercial license. <p>

<li>Q: Can I charge for my application? <p>

   A: If you have a commercial license; of course. If you have a free
license your software must be freely distributable and you must include
the source. <p>

The free license is intended for _free_ software.  We realize that CD-ROMs
cost money to produce, for example, so you can charge a copying fee. <p>

<li>Q: Where can I find Qt?  <p>

    A: The latest version of Qt can be downloaded from the web or from
ftp.troll.no, or (less often updated) from sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/X11/devel/ (or /pub/Linux/Incoming). <p>

<li>Q: Who is Troll Tech and what are your future plans?  <p>

    A: Troll Tech consists of four talented, hard-working programmers who
work day and night to improve Qt, and enjoy it. We started the company in
1993, but parts of Qt were written for earlier projects. The first line of
code was written in 1992. <p>

Most of our income comes from a contract with a beta customer; we develop
code based on Qt for the Norwegian division of NCR (previously AT&T). <p>

<li>Q: Can I use Qt's classes without writing a graphical user interface?  <p>

    A: Quite a few of the classes can be used independently of the user
interface. See utility classes, There are also a few classes that will
work without the GUI only by chance. <p>


<li>Q: I want to port Qt to a new platform.  What do I do? <p>

    A: If the new platform is POSIX-like and runs the X Window System, it's
       simple.  Read the file PORTING for details. If you succeed you can
       send us the patches.  When we've added your patches to our source
       tree, Qt will officially support the new platform.
<p>

<li>Q: Will Qt be available for [OS/2, Mac, Amiga]? <p>

    A: At present, Qt only works well on X11 and Win32 (Windows 95 and
Windows NT).  Porting to other platforms is a lower priority.  Currently,
we concentrate on the Windows and X versions. <p>

<li>Q: Can I make a Qt shared library and distribute it with my Linux
distribution? <p>

    A: Yes, if you do not make changes to Qt and include all the files
present in our distribution of Qt.  (That is, you must include the source
code.) <p>

<li>Q: Can I distribute dynamically linked applications that use Qt?
Can I distribute statically linked applications that use Qt? <p>

    A: Yes and yes, as long as you do not modify Qt. <p>

<li>Q: I need to modify Qt <p>

    A: Are you sure?  Inheritance is very often a  better alternative.  If
you do change Qt, you may not distribute  the modified toolkit or programs
using it. <p>

We encourage you to send patches to qt-bugs@troll.no.  We will try to
evaluate the patches and reply as soon as they come in.  If we like what
we see, we'll incorporate it in the next Qt release. <p>

<li>Q: How can I distribute my cool widget library? <p>

    A: In several ways.  Pick and choose. <p>

If the library is small, a widget or two, perhaps the best way is to
submit it as a contribution to Qt. <p>

If it's larger, you can distribute it, and you can include Qt along with
it.  But you _cannot_ include Qt _as_part_of_ your library (e.g. by making
a shared library which includes Qt and your library). <p>

People must still be aware that they are using Qt, and they must have a
license for Qt. <p>

This applies to wrapper libraries as well, of course.  If you write Ada or
Perl bindings, fine.  But anyone who uses your bindings must also have a
license for Qt. <p>

<li>Q: I found this obscure bug and I need it fixed, fast! <p>

    A: We sell support and maintenance contracts.  We try to support the free
users, and we take all bug reports seriously, no matter who they come
from. <p>

But, of course, if there's too much to do we have to put more emphasis on
paying customers. <p>

<title>Qt toolkit - overview</title>
</head><body>

This is the announcement of Qt 0.93, the fifth public beta version, with
minor updates.

<h1>The Qt Application Framework</h1>

Qt is a high-performance object-oriented framework for developing graphical
user interface (GUI) applications.

<p>

Qt can be downloaded from <a
href=http://www.troll.no/>http://www.troll.no/</a>, where you find
on-line documentation and other Qt-related pages, as well.

<p>

It is also ftp'able from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/Incoming, hopefully
soon /pub/Linux/X11/devel/, and from ftp.nvg.unit.no in /pub/linux/qt.

<p>

If you find any bugs, send a report to
<a href=mailto:qt-bugs@troll.no>qt-bugs@troll.no</a>

<p>

If you create a nice Qt program and want us to distribute it as a contrib,
send us a line at <a href=mailto:info@troll.no>info@troll.no</a>.

<p>

There is a mailing list for Qt users. Send a message containing the single
word "subscribe" to <a href=mailto:qt-interest-request@nvg.unit.no>
qt-interest-request@nvg.unit.no</a> to join the list.
You will receive a receipt from the list server within a few minutes.

<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>
</head><body>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60; URL=easteregg2.html">

<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
<h2>You've found our easter egg</h2>
<h6>No prizes, though</h6>
<p>
A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a Netscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
Netscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."
</blockquote>
Amen!
