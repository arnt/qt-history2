<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60"; URL="easteregg2.html">
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<center><h1>Congratulations!<br>
You've found our easter egg</h1><br clear="all">
<p><small>No prizes, though</small>
</center>

<p>A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a N*tscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
N*tscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."
</blockquote>
Amen!
