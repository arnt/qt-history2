  \class QMap qmap.h
  \brief The QMap class is a value-based template class that provides a dictionary.

  \ingroup qtl
  \ingroup tools
  \ingroup shared
  \mainclass

  QMap is a Qt implementation of an STL-like map container.  It
  can be used in your application if the standard map<> is not
  available.  QMap is part of the \link qtl.html Qt Template
  Library\endlink.

  QMap<Key,Data> defines a template instance to create a dictionary
  with keys of type Key and values of type Data. QMap does not store
  pointers to the members of the map. Instead, it holds a copy of
  every member. For that reason this kind of classes is called
  "value-based", whereas QPtrList and QDict are "reference-based".

  QMap contains and manages a collection of objects of type Data with
  associated key values of type Key and provides iterators that allow
  the contained objects to be addressed.  QMap owns the contained
  elements.  For more relaxed ownership semantics, see QPtrCollection and
  friends which are pointer-based containers.

  Some classes cannot be used within a QMap - for example everything
  derived from QObject and thus all classes that implement widgets.
  Only values can be used in a QMap. To qualify as a value, the class
  must provide

  \list
  \i A copy constructor
  \i An assignment operator
  \i A default constructor, i.e. a constructor that does not take any arguments.
  \endlist

  Note that C++ defaults to field-by-field assignment operators and
  copy constructors if no explicit version is supplied. In many cases,
  this is sufficient.

  QMap uses an STL-like syntax to manipulate and address the
  objects it contains.  For historical reasons, QMap contains
  additional functions which essentially perform the same task.  It is
  recommended that the STL-like functions be used in application code
  to ease the transition to a future version of Qt.  See the <a
  href="qtl.html">Qt Template Library</a> for more information.

  The class used for the key requires that the \c operator< is implemented
  to define ordering of the keys.

  Example:
  \target qmap-eg
\code
#include <qstring.h>
#include <qmap.h>
#include <qstring.h>

class Employee
{
public:
    Employee(): sn(0) {}
    Employee( const QString& forename, const QString& surname, int salary )
	: fn(forename), sn(surname), sal(salary)
    {}

    QString forename() const { return fn; }
    QString surname() const { return sn; }
    int salary() const { return sal; }
    void setSalary( int salary ) { sal = salary; }
private:
    QString fn;
    QString sn;
    int sal;
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    QApplication app( argc, argv );

    typedef QMap<QString,Employee> EmployeeMap;
    EmployeeMap map;

    map["JD001"] = Employee("John", "Doe", 50000);
    map["JD002"] = Employee("Jane", "Williams", 80000);
    map["TJ001"] = Employee("Tom", "Jones", 60000);

    Employee sasha( "Sasha", "Hind", 50000 );
    map["SH001"] = sasha ;
    sasha.setSalary( 40000 );

    EmployeeMap::Iterator it;
    for( it = map.begin(); it != map.end(); ++it ) {
	printf( "%s: %s, %s earns %d\n",
	    it.key().latin1(),
	    it.data().surname().latin1(),
	    it.data().forename().latin1(),
	    it.data().salary() );
    }
    return 0;
}
\endcode

  Program output:
\code
JD001: Doe, John earns 50000
JW002: Williams, Jane earns 80000
SH001: Hind, Sasha earns 50000
TJ001: Jones, Tom earns 60000
\endcode

  As you can see, the latest changes to Sasha's salary did not affect
  the value in the list because the map created a copy of Sasha's
  entry. In addition, notice that the items are sorted alphabetically
  (by key) when iterating over the map.

  There are several ways to find items in a map.  The begin() and
  end() functions return iterators to the beginning and end of the
  map. The advantage of using an iterator is that you can move
  forward or backward by incrementing/decrementing
  the iterator.  The iterator returned by end() points to the element
  which is one past the last element in the container. The
  past-the-end iterator is still associated with the map it belongs
  to, however it is \e not dereferenceable; operator*() will not
  return a well-defined value. If the map is empty(), the iterator
  returned by begin() will equal the iterator returned by end().
  Since end() returns a past-the-end iterator, the size() of the list
  is equal to end() - begin().

  Another way to find an element in the map is by using the find()
  function. This returns an iterator pointing to the desired
  item or to the end() iterator if no such element exists.

  Another approach uses the operator[]. But be warned: if the map does
  not contain an entry for the element you are looking for, operator[]
  inserts a default value.  If you do not know that the element you
  are searching for is really in the list, you should not use
  operator[]. The following example illustrates this:

  \code
	QMap<QString,QString> map;
	map["Weis"] = "Torben";
	str << map["Weis"] << map["Ettrich"] << endl;

  \endcode

  The code fragment will print out "Torben", "".  Since the value
  associated with the "Ettrich" key did not exist, the map inserted a
  default value (in this case, an empty string).  If you are not
  sure whether a certain element is in the map, you should use find()
  and iterators instead.

  If you just want to know whether a certain key is contained in the
  map, use the count() function. In addition, size() tells you how
  many keys there are currently in the map.

  It is safe to have multiple iterators at the same time. If some
  member of the map is removed, only iterators pointing to the removed
  member become invalid; inserting in the map does not invalidate any
  iterators.

  Since QMap is value-based, there is no need to be concerned about deleting
  elements in the map. The map holds its own copies and will free
  them if the corresponding member or the map itself is deleted. You
  can force the map to free all its item with clear().

  QMap is implicitly shared. This means you can just make copies of
  the map in time O(1). If multiple QMap instances share the same data
  and one is modifying the map's data, this modifying instance
  makes a copy and modifies its private copy; it thus does not affect
  other instances.  From a developer's point of view you can think
  that a QMap and a copy of this map have nothing to do with each
  other. If a QMap is being used in a multi-threaded program, you must
  protect all access to the map.  See QMutex.

  There are several ways of inserting new elements into the map. One
  uses the insert() method; the other one uses operator[] like this:

  \code
  	QMap<QString,QString> map;
	map["Weis"] = "Torben";
	map.insert( qMakePair( "Berton","Dave" ) );
  \endcode

  Items can also be removed from the map in several ways. The first is
  to pass an iterator to erase(). The other is to pass a key
  value to erase(), which will delete the entry with the requested
  key. In addition you can clear the entire map using the clear()
  method.

  \class QMapIterator qmap.h
  \brief The QMapIterator class provides an iterator for QMap.

  \ingroup qtl
  \ingroup tools

  You cannot create an iterator by yourself. Instead, you have to ask
  a map to give you one. An iterator is as big as a pointer;
  on 32-bit machines that means 4 bytes, on 64-bit ones 8 bytes. That makes
  copying them very fast. They resemble the semantics of pointers as
  much as possible, and they are almost as fast as usual pointers.
    See the \link qmap.html#qmap-eg QMap example\endlink.

  The only way to traverse a map is to use iterators.  QMap is highly
  optimized for performance and memory usage.  On the other hand this
  means that you have to be a bit more careful with what you are
  doing. QMap does not know about all its iterators, and the iterators
  don't even know to which map they belong. That makes things fast but
  a bit dangerous because it is up to you to make sure that the
  iterators you are using are still valid. QDictIterator will be able
  to give warnings, whereas QMapIterator may end up in an undefined
  state.

  For every Iterator there is also a ConstIterator. You have to use
  the ConstIterator to access a QMap in a const environment or if the
  reference or pointer to the map is itself const. Its semantics are
  the same, but it returns only const references to the item it points
  to.
