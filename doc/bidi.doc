\title Porting applications to Hebrew and Arabic

Even though Qt tries to remove most of the burden of enabling applications for
Hebrew and Arabic from the programmer, there are a few points left where the
programmer has to take care. This document will try to describe most of the
problems that can occur when trying to translate and use the application in
Hebrew or Arabic.

<h2>Difference with other languages</h2>

Hebrew and arabic are different from most other languages in that they are
written from right to left. Numbers and english words embedded in a hebrew or
arabic sentence however are still written left to right. Text is however stored
on disk in the logical order, so displaying and editing has to use an algorithm
to reorder the string into the visual order the user would expect.

A simple example is the following string (big letters are Hebrew or Arabic):
<pre>
THIS IS AN english WORD.
</pre>

The visual output of this would be:

<pre>
.DROW english NA SI SIHT
</pre>

Qt takes care of all these formatting and reordering issues internally, so you
will not have to care about it.

Another big difference is that the whole user interface is mirrored. So a
dialog which would usually be laid out from left to right will be laid out
right to left in Hebrew and Arabic. If you use QLayout, this will be done
automatically inside of Qt, and all dialogs should come out reversed if the app
is translated to hebrew or arabic. You can try this effect yourself, by
starting the app with the -reverse command line switch.

<h2>Things ot take care of</h2>

First of all, as for any other app that is supposed to be internationalized,
don't use fixed layouts.  Use QLayout instead. This will ensure automatically,
that your application will look the right way when  translated to hebrew or
arabic.

There are a few functions kept for compatibilty with older applications that
might lead to unexpected  or wrong results when used in a right to left
language

<h2>Functions you should avoid</h2>

QHeader::cellPos()

<h2>Functions that might lead to unexpected results</h2>

QSplitter::moveSplitter()

QHeader::offset()
