Distributing Qt for Different Platforms

\section2 Static Qt Applications

To distribute static Qt applications, you need the following file for
all platforms:

\list
\i application executable
\endlist

\section2 Dynamic Qt Applications

To distribute dynamic Qt applications, you will need the following
files for all platforms:

\list
\i application executable
\i the Qt library 
\endlist

The Qt library needs to be either in the same directory as the application
executable or in the directory which is included in the system library
path.

In addition, you need the following platform specific files:

\list
\i Windows: qt.dll
\i Unix/Linux: libqt.so
\i Mac: libqt.so##
\endlist

Finally, you need to include the following plugin files:

\list
\i Plugins used by the application (e.g. styles)
\endlist

Plugins have to be put into a subdirectory under a directory known to
Qt as a plugin directory. The subdirectory has to have the name of the
plugin category (e.g. styles, sqldrivers, designer, etc..). 


\section2 Dynamic Dialogs 

For dynamic dialogs if you use QWidgetFactory, you need the foolwoing
files for all platforms:

\list
\i The same files as used for dynamic Qt applications
\i The QUI Library 
\endlist

The QUI library needs to be either in the same directory as the application
executable or in the directory which is included in the system library
path.

You also need the following platform specific files:

\list
\i Windows: qui.lib
\i Unix/Linux: libqui.so
\i Mac: libqui.so###
\endlist


\section2 Qt Applications that use QSA

For Qt applications that use QSA, you need the following files for all
platforms:

\list 
\i Same as dynamic dialogs
\i QSA library 
\endlist

The QSA library needs to be either in the same directory as the application
executable or in the directory which is included in the system library
path.

In addition, you need the following platform specific files:

\list
\i Windows: qsa.dll
\i Unix/Linux: libqsa.so
\i Mac: libqsa.so##
\endlist

Then you need the Qt Scripter plugin files. The Qt Scripter plugin has
to be put into a subdirectory called "qsa",  under a directory known
to Qt as a plugin directory. The platform specific files are as
follows:

\list
\i Windows: quickide.dll
\i Unix/Linux: quickide.so
\i Mac: quickide.so##
\endlist

Finally, you need the QSA Custom Widgets plugin. The QSA Custom Widgets plugin plugin has to be put into a subdirectory called "qsa" under a directory known to Qt as a plugin directory. The following are the platform specific files:

\list
\i Windows: quickcustom.dll
\i Unix/Linux: quickcustom.so
\i Mac: quickcustom.so##
\endlist
