/*!
  \class QInterfaceManager qinterfacemanager.h
  \brief The QInterfaceManager template provides basic functions to access features provided in libraries.

  \ingroup components
*/

/*!
  \fn QInterfaceManager::QInterfaceManager( const QGuid& id, const QString& path = QString::null, const QString& filter = "*.dll; *.so", QLibrary::Policy pol = QLibrary::Default )

  Creates an QInterfaceManager that will load all library files in \a path that match \a filter. If the library provides an
  interface that matches \a id, the functionality of that interface will be available using \code queryInterface( "feature" ) \endcode.
  All managed libraries will stay in memory if the default policy is OptimizeSpeed, otherwise they are unloaded again.

  The \a appIface and \a pol parameters are propagated to the QLibrary object created for each library.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QInterfaceManager::addLibraryPath( const QString& path, const QString& filter = "*.dll; *.so" )

  Calls addLibrary for all files in \a path that match \a filter. 
  The current library policy will be used for all new QLibrary objects.

  \sa addLibrary, setDefaultPolicy
*/

/*!
  \fn QLibrary* QInterfaceManager::addLibrary( const QString& file )

  Tries to load the library file \a file, adds the library to the managed list and
  returns the created QLibrary object if successful, otherwise returns 0.
  The library will stay in memory if the default policy is OptimizeSpeed, otherwise it gets unloaded again.

  \sa removeLibrary, addLibraryPath
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QInterfaceManager::removeLibrary( const QString& file )

  Removes the library \a file from the managed list and returns TRUE if the library could
  be unloaded, otherwise returns FALSE.

  \sa addLibrary
*/

/*!
  \fn void QInterfaceManager::setDefaultPolicy( QLibrary::Policy pol )

  Sets the default policy for this library manager to \a pol. The default policy is
  propagated to all newly created QLibrary objects.

  \sa defaultPolicy
*/

/*!
  \fn QLibrary::Policy QInterfaceManager::defaultPolicy() const

  Returns the current default policy.

  \sa setDefaultPolicy
*/

/*!
  \fn Type* QInterfaceManager::queryInterface(const QString& feature) const

  Returns a pointer to the interface providing \a feature.

  \sa featureList, library
*/

/*!
  \fn QLibrary* QInterfaceManager::library( const QString& feature ) const

  Returns a pointer to the QLibrary representing the library providing \a feature.

  \sa featureList, libraryList
*/

/*!
  \fn QStringList QInterfaceManager::featureList() const

  Returns a list of all features provided by the interfaces managed through this 
  interface manager.

  \sa library, queryInterface
*/

/*!
  \fn QLibrary* QInterfaceManager::libraryFromFile( const QString& fileName ) const

  Returns a pointer to the QLibrary object representing library \a fileName.

  \sa library, libraryList
*/

/*!
  \fn QStringList QInterfaceManager::libraryList() const

  Returns a list of all libraries managed through this interface manager.

  \sa libraryFromFile
*/
