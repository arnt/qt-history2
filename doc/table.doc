\title Qt Table Module

This module is part of the <a href="editions.html">Qt Enterprise Edition</a>.

The table module provides a flexible and editable table widget, \l
QTable. For many applications QTables can be used directly and simply,
providing a grid of editable cells. QTable can also be subclassed in a
straightforward way to provide very large sparse tables, e.g. one
million by one million cells.

The table module provides the following classes:
<ul>
<li> \l QTable itself is the abstract widget of choice whenever you need to
    provide your users with the ability to display and edit
  tabular data such as spreadsheet or database data.
<li> \l QTableItem objects are used to populate a QTable with data with
each table item holding the contents of a cell. 
<li> The \l QComboTableItem class provides memory-efficient combobox items for QTables. 
<li> The \l QCheckTableItem class provides memory-efficient checkbox items for QTables.
<li> \l QTableSelection provides access to selections of cells in a QTable.  
<li> QHeader provides access to the table's horizontal header (column
headers) and vertical header (row headers).
</ul>


Please see the appropriate class documentation for
details and refer to the \link table-examples.html Qt table examples \endlink
for practical demonstration.
