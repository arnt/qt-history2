\title Qt Table Module

The table module provides a flexible and editable table widget dubbed \l QTable.

<center>
\link qtable.html <img src="qtable.png" alt="Screenshot of QTable"> \endlink
</center>

It consists of the following classes:
<ul>
<li> \l QTable is the abstract widget of choice whenever you need to present
  spreadsheet data to the user or let the user edit such data.
<li> \l QTableItem objects are used to populate a QTable with data: 
  each of them contains the content for one cell. 
<li> The \l QComboTableItem class provides a convenient way to
  put combo box items in a QTable. 
<li> \l QCheckTableItem implements a convenient class to
  integrate check box items into a QTable. 
<li> \l QTableSelection provides access to selected areas in a
  QTable.  
<li> With the \l QTableHeader class it is possible to create table header objects. 
  As each QTable already comes with a header column and row
  it is quite likely that you'll never use this class.
</ul>


Please see the appropriate class documentation for
details and refer to the \link table-examples.html Qt table examples \endlink
for practical demonstration.
