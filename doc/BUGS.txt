Critical
--------


Severe
------

drawText() on a printer (Win32)
    Text produces garbage (Win98) and is not scaled correctly (support/arc-07/15339)

QClipboard on Win32
    Pasting images from e.g. MS Paint doesn't work, or only for some color depths

QCursor on Win32
    Some cursors (e.g. Cross) only work for the default cursor set
    Custom cursors are not masked correctly on 8bit color depth

Small
-----

QArray
    For some reason, sorting a QArray<int> does not work, but QArray<char> does. (qt-bugs/arc-07/14998)

QPopupMenu
    Fix updateItem() (qt-bugs/arc-06/13748).

QFileDialog
    Heed the ExistingFile flag (#if 0ed out for 2.2)

QWorkspace
    QWidget::isMinimzed(), isMaximized() return wrong value

WType_Popup
    Children don't get enter/leave events.

QUrl
    Directories that contain the '\' character cannot be read properly by QUrl (it
    hoses the name in slashify()) (qt-bugs/arc-07/15583)

Drag'n'Drop (Win32)
    QListView-folders don't open

SGI Style/MotifPlus style
    Changing the palette of a widget while the mouse is over it will reset the palette when leave

QMultiLineEdit
    When using fonts (appears to be all fonts) of a size bigger than 10 points, the cursor will 
    not move when the TAB key is pressed at the beginning of the line.  The text is correctly placed
    however.  (Was: Lucida font problem)

QToolButton/popups
    See qt-bugs/arc-08/16903

Cosmetic
--------

QProgressBar
    Avoid flickering. This means caching both the percentage value (which is
    already done) and the pixel position (which has not been done yet).

QPrintDialog
    Try making it fit in a 640x480 display.

QFileDialog
    QFileDialog::getOpenFileName( "*" ) gets confused.

QMainWindow/QToolBar
    Toolbar dragging produces rubbish qt-bugs/arc-07/15183
