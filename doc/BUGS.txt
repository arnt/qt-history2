drawText() on a printer (Win32)
    Text produces garbage (Win98) and is not scaled correctly (support/arc-07/15339)

QClipboard on Win32
    Pasting images from e.g. MS Paint doesn't work, or only for some color depths

QCursor on Win32
    Some cursors (e.g. Cross) only work for the default cursor set
    Custom cursors are not masked correctly on 8bit color depth

Small
-----

QArray
    For some reason, sorting a QArray<int> does not work, but QArray<char> does. (qt-bugs/arc-07/14998)

QPopupMenu
    Fix updateItem() (qt-bugs/arc-06/13748).

Dual Monitor support (Win32)
    TLW-Widgets with WType_Popup appear on main-screen

QFileDialog
    Heed the ExistingFile flag (#if 0ed out for 2.2)

QToolButton (for 3.0)
    Should use QColorRole::ButtonText to draw the text, not foreground!

QWorkspace
    QWidget::isMinimzed(), isMaximized() return wrong value

WType_Popup
    Children don't get enter/leave events.

Accelerator eating broken, this time on Unix
    Ref. support/arc-08/16327

QMultiLineEdit doesn't show scrollbars in MDI
    Ref. qt-bugs/arc-07/15500

    QListView-folders don't open

SGI Style/MotifPlus style
    Changing the palette of a widget while the mouse is over it will reset the palette when leave

Cosmetic
--------

QProgressBar
    Avoid flickering. This means caching both the percentage value (which is
    already done) and the pixel position (which has not been done yet).

QPrintDialog
    Try making it fit in a 640x480 display.

QFileDialog
    QFileDialog::getOpenFileName( "*" ) gets confused.
