Critical
--------


Severe
------

static usage of QFileDialog on Borland (Win32)
    API-call doesn't seem to work, so use Qt dialog as workaround

QApplication::widgetAt (Win32)
    This function does not work as expected (support/arc-07/14942 ff.)

drawText() on a printer (Win32)
    Text produces garbage (Win98) and is not scaled correctly (support/arc-07/15339)

QClipboard on Win32
    Pasting images from e.g. MS Paint doesn't work, or only for some color depths

QCursor on Win32
    Some cursors (e.g. Cross) only work for the default cursor set
    Custom cursors are not masked correctly on 8bit color depth

Small
-----

QPopupMenu
    Fix updateItem() (qt-bugs/arc-06/13748).

Dual Monitor support (Win32)
    TLW-Widgets with WType_Popup appear on main-screen

QFileDialog
    Heed the ExistingFile flag (#if 0ed out for 2.2)

Cosmetic
--------

QProgressBar
    Avoid flickering. This means caching both the percentage value (which is
    already done) and the pixel position (which has not been done yet).

QPrintDialog
    Try making it fit in a 640x480 display.

QFileDialog
    QFileDialog::getOpenFileName( "*" ) gets confused.

QEffects
    Submenus are not on top of parent while fading
