Critical
--------


Severe
------

static usage of QFileDialog on Borland (Win32)
    API-call doesn't seem to work, so use Qt dialog as workaround

drawText() on a printer (Win32)
    Text produces garbage (Win98) and is not scaled correctly (support/arc-07/15339)

QClipboard on Win32
    Pasting images from e.g. MS Paint doesn't work, or only for some color depths

QCursor on Win32
    Some cursors (e.g. Cross) only work for the default cursor set
    Custom cursors are not masked correctly on 8bit color depth

Small
-----

QArray
    For some reason, sorting a QArray<int> does not work, but QArray<char> does. (qt-bugs/arc-07/14998)

QPopupMenu
    Fix updateItem() (qt-bugs/arc-06/13748).

Dual Monitor support (Win32)
    TLW-Widgets with WType_Popup appear on main-screen

QFileDialog
    Heed the ExistingFile flag (#if 0ed out for 2.2)
    Look In: history combo does not summarize correctly (qt-bugs/arc-07/15215)

QToolButton (for 3.0)
    Should use QColorRole::ButtonText to draw the text, not foreground!

QWorkspace
    QWidget::isMinimzed(), isMaximized() return wrong value, and setFocus doesn't de-iconify child

WType_Popup
    Children don't get enter/leave events.

QListBox
    Inserting items in an empty listbox *with* focus doesn't emit highlighted signal

Accelerator eating broken, this time on Unix
    Ref. support/arc-08/16327

QMultiLineEdit doesn't show scrollbars in MDI
    Ref. qt-bugs/arc-07/15500

Cosmetic
--------

QProgressBar
    Avoid flickering. This means caching both the percentage value (which is
    already done) and the pixel position (which has not been done yet).

QPrintDialog
    Try making it fit in a 640x480 display.

QFileDialog
    QFileDialog::getOpenFileName( "*" ) gets confused.

QEffects
    Submenus are not on top of parent while fading

QMainWindow/QToolBar
    Hiding a second toolbar produces debug output (support/arc-08/16011)
    Toolbar dragging produces rubbish qt-bugs/arc-07/15183

QListView
    remove column produces debug output. (qt-bugs/arc-07/15037)

QWidget
    colorGroup should return the active colorgroup ONLY if the widget has the focus
    This is done, but somehow the inactive colorgroup is completely bogus
