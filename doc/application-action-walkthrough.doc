\title Walkthrough: A Simple Application with Actions

While reading through the implementation of the 
<A HREF="simple-application.html#ApplicationWindow">\e ApplicationWindow constructor</A> 
you have maybe asked yourself: "The \e fileOpen tool-button
in the toolbar does exactly the same thing as the \e File->Open menu-entry.
Their "What's this?" help is the same, the icons common, the same
slot is connected to both them ...
Shouldn't it be possible to save some code and don't invent
the wheel twice?"

Indeed, it is. In modern GUI-application programming you will use
so called \e actions to do this. An action collects all the
common items (icon, tooltip, menu-entry text, shortcuts, "What's this?" help-text
and what to do -- the actual action) together. Whenever this action is required
(in the toolbar, as a menu-entry) all the programmer has to do is
to insert the action in the respective toolbar or menu. 
Its appearance (as a tool-button or a menu-entry) is something, the
programmer does not has to worry about -- it's obvious from the context.

With the \l QAction class, Qt provides you with everything you need 
to use this striking concept. So let's write an 
\e ApplicationWindow constructor that makes use of actions.


<h2>The ApplicationWindow constructor with Actions</h2>

\quotefile action/application.cpp

<a name="ApplicationWindow"></a>
\skipto ApplicationWindow::ApplicationWindow
\printline ApplicationWindow::ApplicationWindow
\printuntil QPrinter

Nothing new so far. But with the next lines...

\printline fileNewAction;
\printuntil fileQuitAction;

... the difference becomes obvious. Here we define the actions our application
is supposed to undertake: it should create a new editor-instance (\e fileNewAction),
open a file, save a file, save it under a different name, print the
content of the editor, close an editor window and quit the entire application.

\printline "New"

The first one has the name \e new and can be reached via the accelerator \e Ctrl+N.
When used as a menu-entry it will provide the entry \e New and can be reached 
via the accelerator \e Alt-N (\e &N). As we won't set a special tooltip-text, the
text \e New with the accelerator \e Ctrl+N in brackets will show up when
a user holds the mouse over a tool-button and does nothing.

\printuntil newDoc()

When the action becomes activated (the user chooses the respective 
menu-entry or clicks an appropriate tool-button), it connects to the
<A HREF="simple-application.html#newDoc()">\e newDoc()</A> slot.  

\printuntil choose()

The same way we create an \e Open \e File action and connect its \e activated() signal
to the <A HREF="simple-application.html#choose()">\e choose()</A> slot.
There is however a novelty: the \e fileOpenAction (unlike \e fileNewAction)
is assigned a pixmap (the one included with the \e fileopen.xpm file). 

\printuntil </p>

For the \e fileOpenAction we want to provide "What's This?" help and therefore
define an appropriate rich-text. 

\printline defaultFactory()->setPixmap( "fileopen"
\printline fileOpenAction->iconSet()

As \e fileOpenText makes use of a pixmap, we have to inform the rich-text
engine that it should provide the pixmap defined for \e fileOpenAction 
whenever a rich-text
asks for an image-source named \e fileopen.

The slightly complex procedure to gain the pixmap from the action is
due to the fact that a \l QAction is not simply assigned a pixmap but an
entire iconset. A \l QIconSet provides up to six pixmaps suited for
different sizes (large, small) and modes (active, disabled etc.).
As we initially fed \e fileOpenAction with just one pixmap its iconset
will be calculated from it automatically. 

For simplicity reasons we want the icon in the "What's this?" text to be the same we 
used in the \e fileOpenAction constructor. This is done by using
\l QIconSet::pixmap() upon \e fileOpenAction's \e iconSet().

\printline setWhatsThis( fileOpenText )

Finally we assign "What's this?" help to the \e fileOpenAction.

\printuntil setWhatsThis( fileSaveText ); 

The same way we create a \e Save \e File action with a pixmap, "What's this?" help
and the more common items like menu-entry text and accelerator. Note
that we don't have to bother with the rich-text engine because the
pixmap is not used in \e fileSaveText. When activated
the \e fileSaveAction will call the 
<A HREF="simple-application.html#save()">\e save()</A> slot. 

\printuntil setWhatsThis( fileSaveText ); 

For the \e Save \e File \e As action we reuse \e fileSaveText but do without a
pixmap. On activation, this action calls the 
<A HREF="simple-application.html#saveAs()">\e saveAs()</A> slot.   

\printuntil setWhatsThis( filePrintText )

The \e Print \e File action -- with an \e activated() signal connected to 
<A HREF="simple-application.html#printer">\e print()</A> -- looks very much
like \e fileSaveText.

\printuntil close()
\printuntil closeAllWindows()

For the last two actions, \e fileCloseAction and \e fileQuitAction, we do it the
easy way: no "What's this?", no pixmaps. Thus we have defined all the
actions we need.

The only thing left is to use them as menu- and toolbar-entries. 

\printuntil "File Operations" 

First we create a toolbar in \e this window
and define a caption for it. 

As actions that weren't assigned a pixmap are quite useless in a toolbar
we'll restrict ourselves to three tool-buttons for opening, saving 
and printing files.

\printline fileOpenAction

The first tool-button is easily installed: All we have to do 
is to add the \e fileOpenAction to the \e fileTools toolbar.

\printuntil filePrintAction

The same easy procedure applies to \e fileSaveAction and \e filePrintAction.

\printline whatsThisButton

To provide the user with a means to toggle his or her mouse in "What's this?" mode,
we need a fourth icon in the toolbar: the (predefined) "What's this?" button.


\printuntil menuBar()

Next we install the newly created \e file popup-menu in the menu bar.
After we're done with this, we populate the menu ...

\printuntil fileSaveAsAction

... with some menu-entries derived from actions, ...

\printline insertSeparator

... a separator ...

\printuntil fileQuitAction

... and more actions and separators.

The rest of the constructor ...

\printuntil }

... is exactly the same as in the 
<A HREF="simple-application.html#common_constructor">tool-button and menu-entry version</A>.
