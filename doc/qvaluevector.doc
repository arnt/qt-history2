  \class QValueVector qvaluevector.h
  \brief The QValueVector class is a value-based template class that provides a dynamic array.

  \ingroup qtl
  \ingroup tools
  \ingroup shared
  \mainclass

  QValueVector is a Qt implementation of an STL-like vector container.  It
  can be used in your application if the standard \c vector is not
  available.  QValueVector is part of the \link qtl.html  Qt Template
  Library\endlink.

  QValueVector\<T\> defines a template instance to create
  a vector of values that all have the class T. Please note that
  QValueVector does not store pointers to the
  members of the vector; it holds a copy of every member. QValueVector
  is said to be value based; in contrast, QPtrList and QDict are pointer
  based.

  QValueVector contains and manages a collection of objects of type T
  and provides random access iterators that allow the contained
  objects to be addressed.  QValueVector owns the contained items.
  For more relaxed ownership semantics, see QPtrCollection and friends
  which are pointer-based containers.

  QValueVector provides good performance if you append or remove
  items from the end of the vector.  If you insert or remove items
  from anywhere but the end, performance is very poor, since many
  items will need to be copied into new positions.

  Some classes cannot be used within a QValueVector - for example, all classes
  derived from QObject and thus all classes that implement widgets.
  Only values can be used in a QValueVector. To qualify as a value the class
  must provide:

  \list
  \i A copy constructor
  \i An assignment operator
  \i A default constructor, i.e., a constructor that does not take any arguments.
  \endlist

  Note that C++ defaults to field-by-field assignment operators and
  copy constructors if no explicit version is supplied. In many cases
  this is sufficient.

  QValueList's function naming is consistent with the other Qt
  classes (e.g., count(), isEmpty()). QValueList also provides extra
  functions for compatibility with STL algorithms, such as size() and
  empty(). Programmers already familiar with the STL \c list can use
  these functions instead.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qvaluevector.h>
    #include <qstring.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    class Employee
    {
    public:
	Employee(): s(0) {}
	Employee( const QString& name, int salary )
	    : n( name ), s( salary )
	{ }

	QString name() const { return n; }
	int salary() const { return s; }
	void setSalary( int salary ) { s = salary; }

    private:
	QString n;
	int s;
    };

    int main()
    {
	typedef QValueVector<Employee> EmployeeVector;
	EmployeeVector vec( 4 );	// vector of 4 Employees

	vec[0] = Employee( "Bill", 50000 );
	vec[1] = Employee( "Steve", 80000 );
	vec[2] = Employee( "Ron", 60000 );

	Employee joe( "Joe", 50000 );
	vec.append( joe );
	joe.setSalary( 4000 );

	EmployeeVector::iterator it;
	for( it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it )
	    printf( "%s earns %d\n", (*it).name().latin1(), (*it).salary() );

	return 0;
    }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	Bill earns 50000
	Steve earns 80000
	Ron earns 60000
	Joe earns 50000
  \endcode

  As you can see, the latest changes to Joe's salary did not affect the value
  in the vector because the vector created a copy of Joe's entry.

  Many Qt functions return const value vectors; to iterate over these
  you should make a copy and iterate over the copy.

  There are several ways to find items in the vector.  The begin() and
  end() functions return iterators to the beginning and end of the
  vector.  The advantage of getting an iterator is that you can now move
  forward or backward from this position by incrementing/decrementing
  the iterator.  The iterator returned by end() points to the items
  which is one past the last item in the container. The
  past-the-end iterator is still associated with the vector it belongs
  to, however it is \e not dereferenceable; operator*() will not
  return a well-defined value. If the vector is empty(), the iterator
  returned by begin() will equal the iterator returned by end().

  The fastest way to access an item of a vector is by using
  operator[].  This function provides random access and will return a
  reference to the item located at the specified index.  Thus, you
  can access every item directly, in constant time, providing you
  know the location of the item.  It is undefined to access an
  item that does not exist (your application will probably crash).
  For example:

\code
  QValueVector<int> vec1;           // an empty vector
  vec1[10] = 4;                     // undefined, probably a crash

  QValueVector<QString> vec2( 25 ); // initialize with 25 items
  vec2[10] = "Bill";                // OK
\endcode

  Whenever inserting, removing or referencing items in a vector,
  always make sure you are referring to valid positions.  For example:

\code
  void func( QValueVector<int>& vec )
  {
      if ( vec.size() > 9 ) {
          vec[9] = 99; // OK
      }
  }
\endcode

  The iterators provided by vector are random access iterators,
  therefore you can use them with many generic algorithms, for
  example, algorithms provided by the STL or the \link qtl.html QTL\endlink.

  Another way to find an item in the vector is by using the
  std::find() or \link qtl.html#qFind qFind()\endlink
  algorithms.  For example:

\code
  QValueVector<int> vec;
  ...
  QValueVector<int>::const_iterator it = qFind( vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3 );
  if ( it != vector.end() )
      // 'it' points to the found item
\endcode

  It is safe to have multiple iterators on the vector at the same time.
  Since QValueVector manages memory dynamically, all iterators can
  become invalid if a memory reallocation occurs.  For example, if
  some member of the vector is removed, iterators that point to the
  removed item and to all following items become
  invalidated. Inserting into the middle of the vector will
  invalidate all iterators.  For convenience, the function back()
  returns a reference to the last item in the vector, and front()
  one for the first.  If the vector is empty(), both back() and front()
  have undefined behavior (your application will crash or do
  unpredictable things).  Use back() and front() with caution, for
  example:

\code
  QValueVector<int> vec( 3 );
  vec.append( 1 );
  vec.append( 2 );
  vec.append( 3 );
  ...
  if ( !vec.empty() ) {
      // OK: modify the first item
      int& i = vec.front();
      i = 18;
  }
  ...
  QValueVector<double> dvec;
  double d = dvec.back(); // undefined behavior
\endcode

  Because QValueVector manages memory dynamically, it is recommended
  to contruct a vector with an initial size.  Inserting and removing
  items happens fastest when:

\list
	\i Inserting or removing items happens at the end() of the vector
	\i The vector does not need to allocate additional memory
\endlist

  By creating a QValueVector with a sufficiently large initial size,
  there will be less memory allocations.  Do not use an initial size
  that is too big, since it will still take time to construct all the
  empty entries, and the extra space may be wasted if it is never
  used.

  Because QValueVector is value-based there is no need to be careful about
  deleting items in the vector. The vector holds its own copies and
  will free them if the corresponding member or the vector itself is
  deleted. You can force the vector to free all of its items with
  clear().

  QValueVector is shared implicitly, which means it can be copied in
  constant time. If multiple QValueVector instances share the same data
  and one needs to modify its contents, this modifying instance makes
  a copy and modifies its private copy; it thus does not affect the
  other instances.  This is often called "copy on write".  If a
  QValueVector is being used in a multi-threaded program, you must
  protect all access to the vector.  See QMutex.

  There are several ways to insert items into the vector.  The
  append() function insert items into the end of the vector. The
  insert() can be used to add items at specific positions within
  the vector (normally, inserting items at the end() of the vector is
  fastest).

  Items can be also be removed from the vector in several ways. There
  are several variants of the erase() function which removes a
  specific item, or range of items, from the vector.

  Vectors can be also sorted with various STL algorithms , or it can
  be sorted using the \link qtl.html Qt Template Library\endlink.  For
  example with qBubbleSort():

  Example:
  \code
    QValueVector<int> v( 4 );
    v.append( 5 );
    v.append( 8 );
    v.append( 3 );
    v.append( 4 );
    qBubbleSort( v );
  \endcode

  QValueVector stores its items in contiguous memory.  This means
  that you can use a QValueVector in any situation that requires an
  array.
