    \title Qt OpenGL Module

    OpenGL is a standard API for rendering 3D graphics.

    OpenGL only deals with 3D rendering and provides little or no
    support for GUI programming issues. The user interface for an
    OpenGL application must be created with another toolkit, such as
    Motif on the X platform, Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) under
    Windows, or Qt on \e both platforms.

    \bold{Note:} OpenGL is a trademark of Silicon Graphics, Inc. in
    the United States and other countries.

    The Qt OpenGL module makes it easy to use OpenGL in Qt applications.
    It provides an OpenGL widget class that can be used just like any
    other Qt widget, except that it opens an OpenGL display buffer where
    you can use the OpenGL API to render the contents.

    The Qt OpenGL module is implemented as a platform-independent Qt/C++
    wrapper around the platform-dependent GLX, WGL, or AGL C APIs. The
    functionality provided is very similar to Mark Kilgard's GLUT library,
    but with much more non-OpenGL-specific GUI functionality, i.e. the
    whole Qt API.

    \section1 Installation

    When you install Qt for X11, the configure script will autodetect if
    OpenGL headers and libraries are installed on your system, and if so,
    it will include the Qt OpenGL module in the Qt library. (If your
    OpenGL headers or libraries are placed in a non-standard directory,
    you may need to change the QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENGL and/or
    QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENGL in the config file for your system). Some
    configurations require threading to be enabled for OpenGL, so if
    OpenGL is not detected, try \c{configure -thread}.

    When you install Qt for Windows, the Qt OpenGL module is always
    included.

    The Qt OpenGL module is not licensed for use with the Qt Professional
    Edition. Consider upgrading to the Qt Enterprise Edition if you
    require OpenGL support.

    Note about using Mesa on X11: Mesa versions earlier than 3.1 would use
    the name "MesaGL" and "MesaGLU" for the libraries, instead of "GL" and
    "GLU". If you want to use a pre-3.1 version of Mesa, you must change
    the Makefiles to use these library names instead. The easiest way to
    do this is to edit the QMAKE_LIBS_OPENGL line in the config file you
    are using, changing "-lGL -lGLU" to "-lMesaGL -lMesaGLU"; then run
    "configure" again.

    \section1 The QGL Classes

    The OpenGL support classes in Qt are:
    \list
    \i \link QGLWidget QGLWidget\endlink: An easy-to-use Qt
      widget for rendering OpenGL scenes.
    \i \link QGLContext QGLContext\endlink: Encapsulates an OpenGL rendering context.
    \i \link QGLFormat QGLFormat\endlink: Specifies the
    display format of a rendering context.
    \i \link QGLColormap QGLColormap\endlink: Handles indexed
    colormaps in GL-index mode.
    \endlist

    Many applications only need the high-level QGLWidget class. The other
    QGL classes provide advanced features. X11 users might like to read
    the notes on \link opengl-x11-overlays.html overlays\endlink.

    The QGL documentation assumes that you are familiar with OpenGL
    programming. If you're new to the subject a good starting point is
