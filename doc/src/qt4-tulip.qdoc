    \title Qt 4: The Tulip Container Classes

    Qt 4 introduces a new set of containers that will replace both the old
    QCollection pointer-based containers and the newer "QTL" value-based
    containers.

    \section1 General Overview

    The Tulip containers are similar to Qt 3's QTL containers
    (QValueList, QValueVector, QMap), but have the following
    advantages:

    \list
    \o The containers provide new iterators with a nicer, less
       error-prone syntax than STL, inspired by Java's iterators. (The
       STL-style iterators are still available as a lightweight,
       STL-compatible alternative.)

    \o They have been optimized for minimal code expansion.

    \o An empty container performs no memory allocation, and only
       requires the same space as a pointer.

    \o Even though they are implicitly shared, they can safely be copied
        across different threads without formality: there's no need to use
        QDeepCopy.
    \endlist

    Tulip provides the following sequential containers: QList,
    QLinkedList, QVector, QStack, and QQueue. For most
    applications, QList is the best type to use. Although it is
    implemented as an array-list, it provides very fast prepends and
    appends. If you really need a linked-list, use QLinkedList; if you
    want your items to occupy consecutive memory locations, use QVector.
    QStack and QQueue are convenience classes that provide FIFO and
    LIFO semantics.

    Tulip also provides these associative containers: QMap,
    QMultiMap, QHash, and QMultiHash. The "Multi" containers
    conveniently support multiple values associated with a single key. The
    "Hash" containers provide faster lookup by using a hash function
    instead of a binary search on a sorted set.

    The Tulip containers support the foreach keyword, a Qt-specific
    addition to the C++ language that is implemented using the standard
    C++ preprocessor. The syntax is:

    \code
        foreach (variable, container)
            statement;
    \endcode

    Example:

    \code
        QList<QString> list;
        ...
        foreach (QString str, list)
            cout << str.ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    The iterator variable can also be defined outside the loop. For
    example:

    \code
        QString str;
        foreach (str, list)
            cout << str.ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    Just like standard for loops, foreach supports braces, break,
    continue, and nested loops. Qt makes a copy of the container when it
    enters the loop. If you modify the container as you are iterating, that
    won't affect the loop.

    For details about the new containers, see the
    \l{containers.html}{Generic Containers} and
    \l{qtalgorithms.html}{Generic Algorithms} overview documents.

    In addition to the new containers, considerable work has also gone into
    QByteArray and QString. The Qt 3 QCString class has been
    merged with QByteArray. The new QByteArray automatically provides
    a '\0' terminator after the last character. For example, the byte array
    of size 5 containing "abcde" has a null byte at position 5 (one past
    the end). This solves all the typical problems that occurred in Qt 3
    with conversions between QByteArray and QCString.

    To avoid crashes, QByteArray::data() and QString::ascii() never
    return a null pointer. Furthermore, the distinction between null and
    empty strings has been watered down so that \c{QByteArray() ==
    QByteArray("")} and \c{QString() == QString("")}.


    \section1 The State of Tulip

    The Tulip classes are essentially finished and fully documented.


    \section1 Examples

    The first group of examples show how to use the new Java-style
    iterators. The main difference between the Java-style iterators and the
    STL-style iterators is that the Java-style ones point between items (or
    before the first item, or after the last item), whereas the STL ones
    point at an item (or past the last item). One advantage of the
    Java-style iterators is that iterating forward and backward are
    symmetric operations.

    Traversing a container using a Java-style iterator:

    \code
        // forward                                  // backward
        QList<QString> list;                        QList<QString> list;
        ...                                         ...
        QListIterator<QString> i(list);             QListIterator<QString> i(list);        
        while (i.hasNext())                         i.toBack();                            
            cout << i.next().ascii() << endl;       while (i.hasPrev())                    
                                                        cout << i.prev().ascii() << endl;
    \endcode

    Modifying items using a Java-style iterator:

    \code
        // forward                                  // backward
        QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);          QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);  
        while (i.hasNext())                         i.toBack();                         
            if (i.next() > 128)                     while (i.hasPrev())                 
                i.setValue(128);                        if (i.prev() > 128)             
                                                            i.setValue(128);           
    \endcode

    Removing items using a Java-style iterator:

    \code
        // forward                                  // backward
        QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);          QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);                 
        while (i.hasNext())                         i.toBack();                         
            if (i.next() % 2 != 0)                  while (i.hasPrev())                        
                i.remove();                             if (i.prev() % 2 != 0)          
                                                            i.remove();                 
    \endcode

    Iterating over items with a particular value using STL-style vs.
    Java-style iterators:

    \code
        // STL-style                                // Java-style
        QMap<int, QWidget *>::const_iterator i;     QMapIterator<int, QWidget *> i(map);
        for (i = map.begin(); i != map.end(); ++i)  while (i.findNext(widget))
            if (i.value() == widget)                    cout << "Found widget " << widget
                cout << "Found widget " << widget            << " under key "
                     << " under key "                        << i.key() << endl;
                     << i.key() << endl;
    \endcode

    Modifying and removing items using STL-style vs. Java-style
    iterators:

    \code
        // STL-style                                // Java-style
        QList<int>::iterator i = list.begin();      QListMutableIterator<int> i(list);
        while (i != list.end()) {                   while (i.hasNext()) {
            if (*i == 0) {                              int val = i.next();
                i = list.erase(i);                      if (val < 0)
            } else {                                        i.setValue(-val);
                if (*i < 0)                             else if (val == 0)
                    *i = -*i;                               i.remove();
                ++i;                                }
            }
        }
    \endcode

    The next group of examples show the API of the container classes
    themselves. The API is similar to the QTL classes of Qt 3, but is nicer
    in many respects.

    Iterating over a QList using an index (which is fast even for large
    lists, because QList is implemented as an array-list):

    \code
        QList<double> list;
        ...
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); ++i) {
            if (list.at(i) < 0.0)
                list[i] = 0.0;
        }
    \endcode

    Retrieving a value from a map, using a default value if the key
    doesn't exist:

    \code
        QMap<QString, int> map;
        ...
        map.value("TIMEOUT", 30);  // returns 30 if "TIMEOUT" isn't in the map
    \endcode

    Getting all the values for a particular key in a QMultiMap or QMultiHash:

    \code
        QMultiMap<QString, int> map;
        ...
        QList<int> values = map.values("TIMEOUT");
    \endcode

    \section1 Comparison with Qt 3

    Tulip containers are value based. If you want to store a list where
    each item is a QWidget *, use QList<QWidget *>.

    The new containers do not support auto-delete. In practice, we
    discovered that the only case where auto-delete proved worthwhile was
    when the data really should be stored as a value rather than as a
    pointer (e.g., QList<int> rather than QList<int *>). If you need
    to delete all the items in a container, use qDeleteAll().

    If you use QValueList in Qt 3, you can replace it with either
    QList or QLinkedList in Qt 4. In most cases, QList is the best
    choice: It is typically faster, results in less code in your
    executable, and requires less memory. However, QLinkedList's
    iterators provide stronger guarantees, and only QLinkedList provides
    constant-time insertions in the middle, which can make a difference for
    lists with thousands of items.

    If you use QValueVector or QMap in Qt 3, the corresponding Qt 4
    classes (QVector, QMap) are very similar to use.
