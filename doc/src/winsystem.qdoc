    Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, so almost the entire API is the
    same on all platforms and window systems. If you wish to use
    platform-specific features, and still maintain a platform-independent
    source tree, you should protect the platform-specific code using the
    appropriate \c{#ifdef} directives (see below).

    Qt provides a few low-level global functions for fine-tuning
    applications on specific platforms. See \l{Special-Purpose Global
    Functions Exported by Qt} for details.

    For information about which platforms are supported by Qt, see the
    \l{Platform Notes}. For information on distributing Qt applications, see
    \l{Deploying Qt Applications}.

    \target x11
    \section1 Qt/X11

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_X11} is defined.

    \e{Not documented here. Please contact Trolltech Technical Support
    if you have queries.}

    Note: You must compile with XRender support to get alpha transparency
    support for pixmaps and images.

    \target win
    \section1 Qt/Windows

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_WIN} is defined.

    \e{Not documented here. Please contact Trolltech Technical Support
    if you have queries.}

    \target macosx
    \section1 Qt/Mac OS X

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_MAC} is defined.

    \i \l{Qt/Mac is Mac OS X Native}
    \endlist

    \target qws
    \section1 Qtopia Core (Qt for Embedded Linux)

    When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_QWS} is
    defined (the window system is literally the Qt Window System). See
    the \l {Qtopia Core} documentation for more information.
