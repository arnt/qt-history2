    \title ActiveQt Framework
    \brief An overview of Qt's ActiveX and COM integration on Windows.

    \ingroup platform-notes
    \keyword ActiveQt

    Qt's ActiveX and COM support allows Qt/Windows developers to:

    \list 1
    \o Access and use ActiveX controls and COM objects provided by any 
    ActiveX server in their Qt applications.
    \o Make their Qt applications available as COM servers, with
    any number of Qt objects and widgets as COM objects and ActiveX 
    controls.
    \endlist

    The ActiveQt framework consists of two modules:

    \list
    \o The \l QAxContainer module is a static
       library implementing QObject and QWidget subclasses, QAxObject and
       QAxWidget, that act as containers for COM objects and ActiveX
       controls.
    \o The \l QAxServer module is a static library that implements
       functionality for in-process and executable COM servers. This
       module provides the QAxAggregated, QAxBindable and QAxFactory
       classes.
    \endlist

    To build the static libraries, change into the \c activeqt directory 
    (usually \c QTDIR/src/activeqt), and run \c qmake and your make
    tool in both the \c container and the \c control subdirectory.
    The libraries \c qaxcontainer.lib and \c qaxserver.lib will be linked 
    into \c QTDIR/lib.

    If you are using a shared configuration of Qt enter the \c plugin
    subdirectory and run \c qmake and your make tool to build a
    plugin that integrates the QAxContainer module into \l{Qt
    Designer}.

    The ActiveQt modules are part of the \l{Qt Desktop Edition}. They
    are \e not part of the \l{Qt Open Source Edition}.
