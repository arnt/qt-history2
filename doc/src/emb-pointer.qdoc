    \title Qtopia Core Pointer Handling
    \ingroup qtopia-core

    Pointer handling in Qtopia Core works for any mouse or mouse-like
    device such as touch panels and trackballs.

    Usually only one pointer device is supported in an embedded device,
    but for demonstration purposes, Qtopia Core includes a large number of
    supported devices.

    \section1 Mouse Protocols

    Mouse drivers can be enabled/disabled via the configure script.  Running
    \c{./configure} \c{-help} lists the available mouse drivers.  Only the
    "pc" mouse driver is enabled in the default configuration.

    Provided the "pc" mouse driver is enabled, Qtopia Core auto-detects the
    mouse type and device if it is one of
    the supported types on \c /dev/psaux or one of the \c /dev/ttyS?
    serial lines. If multiple mice are detected, all may be used simultaneously.

    Alternatively, you may set the environment variable \c QWS_MOUSE_PROTO
    to determine which mouse to use. This environment variable may be set
    to:
    \quote
        \e{\<protocol\>}\c{:}\e{\<device\>}
    \endquote
    where \e{\<protocol\>} is one of:
    \list
     \i MouseMan
     \i IntelliMouse
     \i Microsoft
    \endlist
    and \e{\<device\>} is the mouse device, often \c /dev/mouse. If no
    such variable is specified, the built-in default is \c Auto, which
    enables auto-detection of the mouse protocol and device.

    To add another protocol, new subclasses of QWSMouseHandler and
    QMouseDriverPlugin can be written and installed as plugins.

    \section1 Touch Panels

    Qtopia Core ships with support for the NEC Vr41XX touch panel and the
    emerging linux touch panel standard used by the iPAQ and Zaurus. These
    are subclasses of QWSCalibratedMouseHandler which is in turn a subclass
    of QWSMouseHandler in \c src/gui/kernel/qmouse_qws.cpp.
