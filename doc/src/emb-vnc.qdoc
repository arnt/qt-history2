    \title Running as a VNC Server
    \ingroup qtopia-core

    The \link http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/ VNC \endlink protocol
    allows you to view and interact with the computer's display from
    anywhere on the network.

    To use Qtopia Core in this way, \c configure Qt with the \c -qt-gfx-vnc
    option, and ensure that you also enable 16-bit display support. Run
    your application like this:
    \code
        application -display VNC:0
    \endcode
    then, run a VNC client pointing at the machine that is running your
    application. For example, using the X11 VNC client to view the
    application from the same machine:
    \code
        vncviewer localhost:0
    \endcode

    By default, Qtopia Core will create a 640 by 480 pixel display. You
    can change this by setting the \c QWS_SIZE environment variable to
    another size, e.g. \c QWS_SIZE=240x320.

    VNC clients are available for a vast array of display systems: X11,
    Windows, Amiga, DOS, VMS, and dozens of others.

    The \link emb-qvfb.html Qt Virtual Framebuffer \endlink is an alternative
    technique. It uses shared memory and thus is much faster and smoother, but
    it does not operate over a network.
