    from Qt 3 to Qt 4.

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \code
        #include <Qt3Support>

    \endcode

    This module is part of the \l{Qt Desktop Edition} and the \l{Qt
    Open Source Edition}. Most classes offered by this module are
    also part of the \l{Qt Desktop Light Edition}.
\if defined(opensourceedition) || defined(desktoplightedition)
