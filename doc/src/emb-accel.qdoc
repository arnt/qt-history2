    \title Adding an Accelerated Graphics Driver
    \ingroup qtopiacore

    Qtopia Core uses Qt's premade raster-based implementation of
    QPaintEngine (\c QRasterPaintEngine) to implement painting
    operations. In addition QScreen implements window
    composition. Both are complete software implementations.

    Painting is performed in two steps: each window is rendered into a
    backingstore using QPaintEngine, and then the server composes the
    backingstore images and copies them to the screen. Composition is
    done by the QScreen::exposeRegion() function which again calls the
    more basic functions QScreen::blit() and QScreen::solidFill().

    In order to make use of accelerated graphics hardware, it is
    possible to derive from QPaintEngine and QScreen.

    The acceleration API is still work in progress, and details are
    subject to change.
