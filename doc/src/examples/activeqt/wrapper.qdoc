    \title Standard Qt widgets as ActiveX controls (in-process)

    The ActiveX controls in this example are the standard button
    classes QPushButton, QCheckBox and QRadioButton as provided by 
    Qt.

    It demonstrates how to export existing QWidget classes as ActiveX
    controls, and the use of QAxFactory together with the QAXFACTORY_EXPORT
    macro.

    \quotefile wrapper/main.cpp 
    \skipto class
    \printuntil };
    The factory implementation returns the list of supported controls,
    creates controls on request and provides information about the unique
    IDs of the COM classes and interfaces for each control.

    \printuntil }
    The factory is exported using the QAXFACTORY_EXPORT macro.

    To build the example you must first build the \link qaxserver.html
    QAxServer \endlink library. Then run qmake and your make tool in 
    \c examples/wrapper.

    The \link qaxserver-demo-wrapper.html demonstration \endlink requires your
    WebBrowser to support ActiveX controls, and scripting to be enabled.
