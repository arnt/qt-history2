    \title About Qt

    Qt is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit created and maintained by
    \l{troll.html}{Trolltech}. It provides application developers with
    all the functionality needed to build applications with
    state-of-the-art graphical user interfaces. Qt is fully
    object-oriented, easily extensible, and allows true component
    programming. Read the \link

    Since its commercial introduction in early 1996, Qt has formed the
    basis of many thousands of successful applications worldwide. Qt is
    also the basis of the popular \link http://www.kde.org/ KDE \endlink
    Linux desktop environment, a standard component of all major Linux
    distributions. See our \link http://www.trolltech.com/success/
