    \title The Qt Resource System

    \keyword resource system

    The Qt resource system is a platform-independent mechanism for
    storing binary files in the application's executable. This is
    useful if your application always needs a certain set of files
    (icons, translation files, etc.) and you don't want to run the
    risk of losing the files.

    The resource system is based on tight cooperation between \c
    qmake, \c rcc (Qt's resource compiler), and QFile. It obsoletes
    Qt 3's \c qembed tool and the
    \l{http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq05-iconography.html#imagestorage}{image
    collection} mechanism.

    \section1 Resource Collection Files (\c{.qrc})

    The resources associated with an application are specified in a
    \c .qrc file, an XML-based file format that lists files on the
    disk and optionally assigns them a resource name that the
    application must use to access the resource.

    Here's an example \c .qrc file:

    \include mainwindows/application/application.qrc

    The resource files listed in the \c .qrc file are files that are
    part of the application's source tree. Paths are relative to the
    directory where the \c .qrc file is located.

    The \c .qrc file must be mentioned in the application's \c .pro
    file so that \c qmake knows about it. For example:

    \quotefromfile mainwindows/application/application.pro
    \skipto RESOURCES
    \printline RESOURCES

    \c qmake will produce make rules to generate a file called \c
    qrc_application.cpp that is linked into the application. This
    file contains all the data for the images and other resources as
    static C++ arrays of compressed binary data. The \c
    qrc_application.cpp file is automatically regenerated whenever
    the \c .qrc file changes or one of the files that it refers to
    changes. If you don't use \c .pro files, you can either invoke \c
    rcc manually or add build rules to your build system.

    Currently, Qt always stores the data directly in the executable,
    even on Windows and Mac OS X, where the operating system provides
    native support for resources. This might change in a future Qt
    release.

    By default, resources are accessible in the application under the
    same name as they have in the source tree, with a \c :/ prefix.
    For example, the path \c :/image/cut.png would give access to the
    \c cut.png file, whose location in the application's source tree
    is \c images/cut.png. This can be changed using the \c file tag's
    \c alias attribute:

    \code
        <file alias="cut-img.png">images/cut.png</file>
    \endcode

    The file is then accessible as \c :/cut-img.png from the
    application. It is also possible to specify a path prefix for all
    files in the \c .qrc file using the \c qresource tag's \c prefix
    attribute:

    \code
        <qresource prefix="/myresources">
            <file alias="cut-img.png">images/cut.png</file>
        </qresource>
    \endcode

    In this case, the file is accessible as \c
    :/myresources/cut-img.png.

    Some resources, such as translation files and icons, many need to
    change based on the user's locale. This is possible using the \c
    lang attribute. For example:

    \code
        <qresource>
            <file>cut.jpg</file>
        </qresource>
        <qresource lang="fr">
            <file alias="cut.jpg">cut_fr.jpg</file>
        </qresource>
    \endcode

    If the user's locale is French (i.e., QLocale::system().name() returns
    "fr_FR"), \c :/cut.jpg becomes a reference to the \c cut_fr.jpg
    image. For other locales, \c cut.jpg is used.

    \section1 Using Resources in the Application

    In the application, resource paths can be used in most places
    instead of ordinary file system paths. In particular, you can
    pass a resource path instead of a file name to the QIcon, QImage,
    or QPixmap constructor:

    \quotefromfile mainwindows/application/mainwindow.cpp
    \skipto cutAct = new QAction(QIcon(":/images/cut.png
    \printuntil ;

    See the \l{mainwindows/application}{Application} example for an
    actual application that uses Qt's resource system to store its
    icons.

    In memory, resources are represented by a tree of resource
    objects. The tree is automatically built at startup and used by
    QFile for resolving paths to resources. You can use a QDir initialized
    with ":/" to navigate through the resource tree from the root.

    Qt's resources support the concept of a search path list. If you then
    refer to a resource with \c : instead of \c :/ as the prefix, the
    resource will be looked up using the search path list. The search
    path list is empty at startup; call QDir::addResourceSearchPath() to
    add paths to it.

    If you have resources in a static library, you might need to
    force initialization of your resources by calling \c
    qInitResources_xxx(), where \c xxx is the base name of the \c
    .qrc file. This function is generated as part for the \c
    qrc_xxx.cpp file. For example:

    \code
        extern int qInitResources_graphlib();

        int main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            QApplication app(argc, argv);
            qInitResources_graphlib();
            ...
            return app.exec();
        }
    \endcode
