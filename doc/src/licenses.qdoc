\title Licenses for Code Used in Qt

Qt contains a little code that is not under the \link qpl.html
QPL\endlink, the \link gpl.html GPL\endlink, or the Qt Commercial
License Agreement, but rather under specific highly permissive
licenses from the original authors. This page lists the licenses used
for that code, names the authors, and links to the points where it is
used.

Trolltech gratefully acknowledges these and others contribution to
Qt. We recommend that all programs that use Qt also acknowledge these
contributions, and quote all these license statements in an appendix
to the documentation.
