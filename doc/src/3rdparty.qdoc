    \section1 FreeType 2 (\c freetype)

    \e{The FreeType project is a team of volunteers who develop free, portable
    and high-quality software solutions for digital typography. We specifically
    target embedded systems and focus on bringing small, efficient and
    ubiquitous products.} -- quoted from \c 3rdparty/freetype/docs/freetype2.html.

    See \c src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/FTL.txt and \c
    src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/GPL.txt for license details.

    See also the files in \c src/3rdparty/opentype, which are used by
    FreeType.

    \section1 The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG Software (\c libjpeg)

    \e{This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
    decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
    method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
    "real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
    are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
    exactly identical to the input image.} -- quoted from \c
    src/3rdparty/libjpeg/README.

    See \c src/3rdparty/libjpeg/README for license details.

    \section1 MNG Library (\c libmng)

    \e{The libmng library supports decoding, displaying, encoding, and various
    other manipulations of the Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format
    image files. It uses the zlib compression library, and optionally the
    JPEG library by the Independant JPEG Group (IJG) and/or
    lcms (little cms), a color-management library by Marti Maria Saguer.}
    -- quoted from \c src/3rdparty/libmng/doc/libmng.txt

    See \c src/3rdparty/libmng/LICENSE for license details.

    \section1 PNG Reference Library (\c libpng)

    \e{Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG specification, as a way
    of reducing the amount of time and effort it takes to support the PNG
    file format in application programs.} -- quoted from \c
    src/3rdparty/libpng/libpng.txt.

    See \c src/3rdparty/libpng/LICENSE for license details.

    \section1 SQLite (\c sqlite)

    \e{SQLite is a small C library that implements a
    self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine.}
    -- quoted from \l{http://www.sqlite.org/}{www.sqlite.org}.

    According to the comments in the source files, the code is in the public
    domain. See the
    \l{http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html}{SQLite Copyright} page on the
    SQLite web site for further information.

    \section1 Wintab API (\c wintab)

    Wintab is a de facto API for pointing devices on Windows. The
    wintab code is from \l{http://www.pointing.com/WINTAB.HTM}.

    See \c src/3rdparty/wintab/wintab.h for license details.

    \section1 Data Compression Library (\c zlib)

    \e{zlib is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code
    is thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described
    by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952} -- quoted from \c
    src/3rdparty/zlib/README.

    See \c src/3rdparty/zlib/README for license details.
