  \title What's New in Qt 4.2

  Qt 4.2 provides many improvements and enhancements over the previous releases
  in the Qt 4 series. This documents covers the most important features in this
  release, separated by category.

  Since we will continue to improve and fine-tune Qt as a result of feedback
  and suggestions from customers and the open source community, we have not
  included a detailed list of changes between Qt 4.1 and this release.
  A comprehensive list of changes between Qt 4.1 and Qt 4.2 will be included
  in the Qt 4.2 final release.

  A list of other Qt 4 features can be found on the
  \bold{\l{What's New in Qt 4}} page.

  \bold{Highlights}

  \tableofcontents

  \section1 Graphics View

  Support for interactive graphics is provided by the \l{Graphics View} framework.
  This framework is an enhanced replacement for the Canvas module, previously
  provided with Qt 3, with a refined set of features.

  \image graphicsview-shapes.png

  The framework enables \bold{responsive handling of large numbers of canvas items}
  through the use of a space-partitioning scheme. Support for collision detection,
  coordinate transformations, and item groups make it easier than before to manage
  items for interactive displays.

  \image elasticnodes-example.png

  An \bold{improved API} aims to make common uses easier while making advanced
  uses more accessible to developers.

  \image graphicsview-map.png

  Graphics View's \bold{enhanced presentation system}, takes advantage of Qt 4's
  paint system to render items using anti-aliasing, and taking advantage of OpenGL
  to improve rendering performance. Support for printing is built into the
  framework, making it possible to produce high quality documents from interactive
  applications.

  \image graphicsview-text.png

  A selection of \bold{predefined item types} is provided that contains, amongst
  others, a text item that supports inline editing.

  In addition, various \l{Qt Examples#Graphics View Examples}{graphics view examples}
  have been written to demonstrate key features of the framework, including ports
  of Canvas module examples from Qt 3.


  \section1 Desktop Integration

  This release introduces a set of features that are designed to make it easier
  to write applications that are integrated into users' desktop environments.

  \bold{The \l{QCleanlooksStyle}{Cleanlooks} widget style}, designed to closely
  resemble the Clearlooks style for GTK+ applications, enables Qt applications
  to fit in with non-Qt applications on suitably-configured GNOME desktops.
  See the \l{Cleanlooks Style Widget Gallery} to see how Qt's widgets look
  in this style.

  QDesktopServices provides \bold{cross-platform support for opening and launching
  URLs}, making it possible for applications to launch a web browser, mail
  composer, and other external resources by using the facilities of the user's
  desktop environment.

  To enable \bold{closer integration with the GNOME deskop environment} and tools,
  Qt 4.2 now contains support for the Glib eventloop. This makes it possible
  for Qt applications to use plugins made using other Glib-based frameworks,
  and even enables Qt plugins to be created for use with non-Qt applications.

  \endraw

  The QDialogButtonBox class enables dialogs to be created that use the
  \bold{appropriate button order for the user's chosen desktop environment}.
  This enables dialogs created for KDE and Windows to be reused for Mac OS X
  and GNOME.

  On X11 platforms, \bold{support for the \l{Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)}}
  has been greatly enhanced. Printer settings made available by CUPS can now be
  accessed via QPrintDialog for improved control over the printing process.

  \bold{System tray support} on all desktop platforms is provided by the new
  QSystemTrayIcon class, which exposes a comprehensive set of features via an
  intuitive Qt-style API.


  \section1 Text Completion Framework

  \image completer-example.png

  The new QCompleter class provides a \bold{framework for handling text completion
  in input widgets}. Completion facilities can be set up for use in QLineEdit,
  QComboBox and custom widgets. An \l{tools/completer}{example is included} which
  shows how text completion can be used with a selection of different models and
  data sets.

  \section1 Widget Stylesheets

  \omit
  \image stylesheets-example-detail.png
  \endomit

  \bold{Widgets can be styled using stylesheets} that follow a syntax similar to
  that used by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for HTML. Many of the more common
  customizations to widget styles can be made using stylesheets, making it largely
  unnecessary for developers to create entire custom widget styles with QStyle
  subclasses.

  The stylesheet for any given widget can be accessed via its
  \l{QWidget::}{styleSheet} property.

  This functionality is being constantly improved, and full documentation
  for this feature will be introduced during the development of Qt 4.2.

  \section1 Undo Framework

  \bold{An \l{Undo framework} based on the
  \l{Books about GUI Design#Design Patterns}{Command pattern}} has been introduced
  to help developers provide undo/redo features in applications. The provision of
  an undo framework in Qt means that developers can take advantage of a common,
  well-tested set of classes to improve usability and concentrate on higher-level
  functionality.

  The framework provides support for command compression to improve usability
  when many low-level or similar repetitive commands are used. Command macros
  can also be employed by developers to enable sequences of commands to be
  programatically applied via the framework in single steps.
  Additionally, the concept of a \e{clean state} is supported, enabling
  applications to clear the undo buffer when certain operations are performed,
  such as saving a file.

  \target D-BUS
  \section1 Inter-Process Communication (D-BUS)

  Qt 4.2 provides support for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using
  the D-BUS protocol. This service-oriented protocol provides fast,
  low latency communication that can be used for same-machine
  communication between applications, yet also allows Remote Procedure
  Calling (RPC) mechanisms to be implemented.

  Using the QtDBus module, an application can provide services to
  other applications by exporting objects, as well as use such
  exported services itself. The QtDBus module also extends Qt's \l
  {Signals and Slots} mechanism, making it possible to connect to
  other applications.

  See the \l{Introduction to D-BUS} document for more information
  about using D-BUS with Qt.

  \section1 New Widgets and GUI Features

  Qt 4.2 also provides a number of new features for graphical user interface
  applications, expanding the range of available widgets while extending overall
  functionality.

  </table>
  \endraw

  A \l{QFontComboBox}{specialized font combobox} is now available for use in text
  editing and related applications.

  \image qcalendarwidget-maximum.png

  Facilities for \bold{displaying monthly calendars and date selection} are
  provided by QCalendarWidget, a class adapted from the \l{Calendar Widget}
  Qt Solution.

  The \bold{\l{Main Window and Related Classes}{main window classes} have been
  updated to be more responsive to user activity}. In particular, when a user
  moves a floating dock window over a dock area by the user, any other dock
  windows in that area will automatically make room to allow it to be dropped
  there. These enhancements can be seen in the
  \l{Dock Widgets Example}{Dock Widgets} example.

  \bold{Access to OpenGL framebuffer objects} is provided by the
  QGLFramebufferObject class; this enables textures to be painted with a series
  of calls to QPainter functions in the usual way for QPaintDevice subclasses.

  \bold{Improved support for platform-native message boxes} is provided by
  QMessageBoxEx. This class uses QDialogButtonBox to positioned buttons using
  the appropriate conventions for the user's platform and desktop environment.

  \section1 Extended Infrastructure

  Many improvements have been made to the classes and tools that provide
  underlying functionality in Qt. Many of these changes involve introducing
  higher level functionality that aims to make application development easier
  while providing a more robust working environment for users.

  The QFileSystemWatcher class enables applications to \bold{monitor files and
  directories for changes}. This feature is often used by applications and
  libraries that share access to files with other applications.

  The \l{Model/View Classes}{item view classes} have been optimized for
  performance and reliability, and new classes have been introduced:
  \list
  \o QStandardItem and QStandardItemEditorCreator aim to make the
     QStandardItemModel class easier to use.
  \o \bold{QDataWidgetMapper enables mappings to be made between items in a model
     and selections of widgets} in a user interface, making it possible to design
     data-aware widgets and forms.
  \endlist

  The \bold{HTML import and export facilities have been enhanced} in the
  \l{Rich Text Processing}{rich text classes}, and now include support for CSS
  stylesheets.

  \bold{A \l{QTimeLine}{time line class} has been introduced for use in widgets
  that provide animations.} By using a mechanism that uses signals and slots to
  notify other application components about changes to a time line, this class
  can also be used for other timing purposes with non-GUI classes.

  The addition of a \bold{Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icon engine} enables
  icons to be created from pictures in this vector graphics format. This reduces
  the number of fixed-size images that developers need to include with
  applications, and avoids the need to provide sufficiently high resolution
  images to cover all possible icon sizes.

  Support for \bold{detection and reporting of network interfaces} is provided by
  the QNetworkInterface class.

  Qt's keyboard handling has been improved to support
  \bold{physical key recognition}.
  This allows keyboard shortcuts to be created that specify the keys that users
  see on their keyboard instead of generic logical key assignments.

  QKeySequence now provides \bold{a range of standard shortcuts} that developers
  can use when creating actions. These describe commonly-used high-level actions,
  such as \gui{Undo}, \gui{Copy}, and \gui{Paste}, and enable shortcuts to be
  specified in a true cross-platform way.

  Support for \l{Qt's Property System#Dynamic Properties}{dynamic properties}
  extends the standard Qt property system, enabling
  \bold{new properties to be added to instances of QObject subclasses at run-time}.

  \section1 Qtopia Core

  Many improvements in Qt are specific to Qtopia Core and are concerned with
  graphics support and rendering performance.

  \bold{Direct painting to the screen} can be enabled on by
  \l{Performance Tuning#Bypassing the Backing Store}{bypassing the backing store}
  on a per-application basis.

  \bold{Support for 18 and 24 bits-per-pixel color depths} has been added to the paint
  system. Color depths that assign 6 bits to each color (or alpha) channel are
  commonly used on mobile devices.

  Alongside many general improvements and optimizations, the \bold{transformed
  screen driver has been optimized} to improve performance when rendering rotated
  content.

  \omit

  \section1 Other Improvements

  Many other enhancements have been made Internally, Other improvements
  Menu handling has been updated to allow widgets to be inserted as menu items.

  Support for widgets in menus.

  * Backing store interface

  * delayed widget creation

  * Linguist improvements

  * Text control (not 100% certain we'll have a public API)
