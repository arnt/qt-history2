    \title Qtopia Core

    The Qtopia Core platform is a C++ framework for GUI and
    application development for embedded devices. It runs on a variety
    of processors, usually with Embedded Linux.  Qtopia Core provides
    the standard Qt API for embedded devices with a lightweight
    windowing system.

    In addition to the class library, Qtopia Core provides means for
    customizing and optimizing the final result: Memory consumption
    can be fine-tuned by compiling out features that are not used, and
    a number of options are available that reduce the memory and CPU
    requirements by making various trade-offs. Keyboard and pointer
    drivers can be specified, as weel as the font output's format. It
    is also possible to make use of accelerated graphics hardware.

    Qtopia Core applications write directly to the framebuffer,
    eliminating the need for the X Window System and saving memory.

    If you do not have a working Linux framebuffer you can use the
    \l {Qtopia Core Virtual Framebuffer}, or you can \l {Qtopia Core as a
    VNC Server}{run Qtopia Core as a VNC server}.
