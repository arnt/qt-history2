    \title Fine-Tuning Features in Qtopia Core
    \ingroup qtopiacore

    It is often a fixed set of applications on an embedded device,
    making it possible to save resources by minimizing the size of the
    associated libraries. The Qt installation can easily be optimized
    by avoiding to compile in the features that are not required.

    To disable a particular feature, just run the \c configure script
    with the \c -no-feature-<feature> option. For example:

    \code
        ./configure -no-feature-thread
    \endcode

    The feature can easily be enabled again by running \c configure
    with the \c -feature-<feature> option.

    You can also disable a \e set of features by creating a custom
    configuration file that defines the preferred subset of Qt's
    functionality. Such a file uses macros to disable the unwanted
    features, and can be created manually or by using the \c qconfig
    tool located in the \c /tools/qconfig directory.

    \note The \c qconfig tool is intended to be built against Qt on
    X11 platforms.

    The \c qconfig tool's interface displays all of Qt's
    functionality, and allows the user to both disable and enable
    features. The user can open and edit any custom configuration file
    located in the \c /src/corelib/global directory. When creating a
    custom configuration file manually, a description of the currently
    available Qt features can be found in the \c
    /src/corelib/global/qfeatures.txt file.

    Note that some features depend on others; disabling any feature
    will automatically disable all features depending on it. The
    feature dependencies can be explored using the \c qconfig tool,
    but they are also described in the \c
    /src/corelib/global/qfeatures.h file.

    To be able to apply the custom configuration, it must be saved in
    a file called \c qconfig-myfile.h in the \c /src/corelib/global
    directory. Then use the \c configure script's \c -qconfig option
    and pass the configuration's filename without the \c qconfig-
    prefix and \c .h extension, as argument. For example:

    \code
        ./configure -qconfig myfile
    \endcode

    Qt provides several ready-made custom configuration files,
    defining minimal, small, medium and large installations,
    respectively. These files are located in the \c
    /src/corelib/global directory.
