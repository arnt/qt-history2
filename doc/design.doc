<h1 align=center>Design Principles</h1><br clear="all">

Here are the design principles behind Qt.  These are guiding principles,
not rules, but they're <em>good</em> principles, and we've stuck to
them almost everywhere in the toolkit.

<h2>GUI Toolkit</h2>

<h2>Portability Toolkit</h2>

<h2>Efficient Implementation</h2>

<h2>Truly Object-Oriented Design</h2>

<h2>Never Dump Core</h2>

<h2>"What you don't know won't hurt you"</h2>

<h2>Uniform Naming in the API</h2>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>

<h2>On-line Documentation</h2>

<h2>Don't Push</h2>
