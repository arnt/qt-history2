  \class QValueStack qvaluestack.h
  \brief The QValueStack class is a value based template class that provides a stack.

  \ingroup qtl
  \ingroup tools

  Define a template instance QValueStack\<X\> to create a stack of values which all
  have the class X. Please notice that QValueStack does not store pointers to the
  members of the stack. It holds a copy of every member. That is the reason why this
  kind of classes are called "value based" while QStack, QList and QDict are "reference based".

  Some classes can not be used within a QValueStack. For example everything derived from
  QObject and as a reason of this that extends to all classes which implement widgets.
  You can only put stuff in a QValueStack which can be easily copied. That means that the
  class X should implement a fast copy constructor.

  A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure. Items are added to
  the top of the stack with push() and retrieved from the top with
  pop(). Furthermore, top() provides access to the topmost item
  without removing it.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qvaluestack.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
	
    void main()
    {
	QValueStack<int> stack;
	stack.push( 1 );
	stack.push( 2 );
	stack.push( 3 );
	while ( !stack.isEmpty() )
		printf("pop item %d\n", stack.pop() );
  }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	pop item 3;
	pop item 2;
	pop item 1;
  \endcode

  Technically, QValueStack is a specialized QValueList provided for
  convenience. All of QValueList's functionality applies also to
  QStack, for example the facility to iterate over all elements using
  QValueStack<T>::Iterator. See QValueListIterator for further details.

*/


/*!
  \fn QValueStack::QValueStack()
  Constructs an empty stack.
*/

/*!
  \fn QValueStack::~QValueStack()
  Destroys the stack. References to the values in the stack and all iterators
  of this stack become invalidated. Since QValueStack is highly tuned for performance
  you wont see warnings if you use invalid iterators,
  because it is impossible for an iterator to check wether it is valid or not.
*/


/*!
  \fn void  QValueStack::push( const T& d )

  Adds an element to the top of the stack.  Last in, first out.

  This function is equivalent to append()

  \sa pop(), top()
*/

/*!
  \fn T& QValueStack::top()
  Returns a reference to the top item of the stack or the item
  referenced by end() if no
  such item exists. Please note that you may not change
  the value the end() Iterator is pointing to.

  This function is equivalent to last().

  \sa pop(), push(), fromLast()
*/


/*!
  \fn const T& QValueStack::top() const
  Returns a reference to the top item of the stack or the item
  referenced by end() if no such item exists.

  This function is equivalent to last().

  \sa pop(), push(), fromLast()
*/

/*!
  \fn T QValueStack::pop()

  Removes the top item from the stack and returns it.
  \sa top()

  \sa push()
*/
