\title The Qt SAX2 implementation

<h2><a name="introSAX2">Introduction to SAX2</h2>

The SAX2 interface is an event-driven mechanism to provide the user with
document information. "Event" in this context has nothing to do with the
term "event" you probably know from windowing systems; it means that the
parser reports certain document information while parsing the document.
These reported information is referred to as "event".

To make it less abstract consider the following example:

\code 
<quote>To make it less abstract consider the following example:</quote>
\endcode

Whilst reading (a SAX2 parser is usually referred to as "reader") 
the above document three events would be triggered:
<OL>
<LI> A start tag occurs (<tt>&lt;quote&gt;</tt>).
<LI> Character data (i.e. text) is found.
<LI> An end tag is parsed (<tt>&lt;/quote&gt;</tt>).
</OL>

Each time such an event occurs the parser reports it so that 
a suitable event handling routine can be invoked.

Whilst this is a fast and simple approach to read XML documents
manipulation is difficult because data are not stored, simply handled
and discarded serially. This is when the DOM interface comes handy.

The Qt XML module provides an
abstract class, \l QXmlReader, that defines the interface for potential 
SAX2 readers.
At the moment Qt ships with one reader implementation, \l
QXmlSimpleReader.

The reader reports parsing events through special handler classes. In Qt
the following ones are available:
<ul>
<li>\l QXmlContentHandler
    reports events related to the content of a document (e.g. the start tag,
    or characters).
<li>\l QXmlDTDHandler
    reports events related to the DTD (e.g. notation declarations).
<li>\l QXmlErrorHandler
    reports errors or warnings that occurred during parsing.
<li>\l QXmlEntityResolver
    reports external entities during parsing and allows the user to resolve
    external entities him- or herself instead of leaving it to the reader.
<li>\l QXmlDeclHandler
    reports further DTD related events (e.g. attribute declarations).
    Usually users are not interested in them, but under certain circumstances
    this class comes handy.
<li>\l QXmlLexicalHandler
    reports events related to the lexical structure of the document
    (the beginning of the DTD, comments etc.). Occasionally this
    might be useful.
</ul>

These classes are abstract classes describing the interface. The
\l QXmlDefaultHandler class provides a "do nothing" default implementation for
all of them. Therefore users need to overload only the
QXmlDefaultHandler functions they are interested in. 

To read input XML data a special class \l QXmlInputSource is used.

Apart from the already mentioned ones the following SAX2 support classes 
provide the user with useful functionality:
<ul>
<li> \l QXmlAttributes
     is used to pass attributes in a start element event.
<li> \l QXmlLocator
     is used to obtain the actual parsing position of an event.
<li> \l QXmlNamespaceSupport
     is used to easily implement namespace support for a reader.
</ul>


<h2><a name="featuresAndProperties">Features and properties</h2>
 
SAX2 allows you to set and query features and properties of an XML reader.
 
Features are simply options that change the behavior of the reader. Every
feature has a unique name, represented as an URI, and a value which can be
TRUE or FALSE.
 
Properties are a more general concept. They also have a unique name,
represented as an URI, but their value is \c void*. So nearly everything
can be used for a property values. This concept involves some danger,
though: there are no means to get type-safety; the user has to take care
that he passes the correct type. Properties are useful if a reader supports
special handler classes, e.g.
 
The URIs used for features and properties are often URLs like
\c http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace. This does not mean that there
must be any data at the address. It is simply a way to define unique names,
not more.
 
Everybody can define and use new SAX2 features and properties for his
readers. There are only two features and no properties that a SAX2 reader
must support: \c http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces and \c
http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes.
 
Features can be set or queried with the three following three functions:
\l QXmlReader::setFeature(), \l QXmlReader::feature() and \l
QXmlReader::hasFeature().
 
Properties can be set or queried with similar functions:
\l QXmlReader::setProperty(), \l QXmlReader::property() and \l
QXmlReader::hasProperty().
