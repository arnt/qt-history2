Critical
--------


Severe
------

static usage of QFileDialog on Borland (Win32)
    API-call doesn't seem to work, so use Qt dialog as workaround</DD>

QApplication::widgetAt (Win32)
    This function does not work as expected (support/arc-07/14942 ff.)</DD>

drawText() on a printer (Win32)
    Text produces garbage (Win98) and is not scaled correctly (support/arc-07/15339)</DD>


Small
-----

QPopupMenu
    Fix <CODE>updateItem()</CODE> (qt-bugs/arc-06/13748).

Dual Monitor support (Win32)
    TLW-Widgets with WType_Popup appear on main-screen</DD>


Cosmetic
--------

QProgressBar
    Avoid flickering. This means caching both the percentage value (which is
    already done) and the pixel position (which has not been done yet).

QPrintDialog
    Try making it fit in a 640x480 display.

QFileDialog
    QFileDialog::getOpenFileName( "*" ) gets confused.
