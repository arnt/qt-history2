\section1 Freetype 2 (freetype)

\e{The FreeType project is a team of volunteers who develop free, portable
and high-quality software solutions for digital typography. We specifically
target embedded systems and focus on bringing small, efficient and
ubiquitous products.} -- quoted from \c 3rdparty/freetype/docs/freetype2.html.

See \c 3rdparty/freetype/docs/FIL.txt and \c
3rdparty/freetype/docs/GPL.txt for license details.

See also the files in \c 3rdparty/opentype which are used by
Freetype.


\section1 The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software (libjpeg)

\e{This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
exactly identical to the input image.} -- quoted from \c
3rdparty/libjpeg/README.

See \c 3rdparty/libjpeg/README for license details.


\section1 Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) Reference Library (libmng)

\e{The libmng library supports decoding, displaying, encoding, and various
other manipulations of the Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format
image files. It uses the zlib compression library, and optionally the
JPEG library by the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) and/or
lcms (little cms), a color-management library by Marti Maria Saguer.}
-- quoted from \c 3rdparty/libmng/doc/libmng.txt.

See \c 3rdparty/libmng/LICENSE for license details.


\section1 PNG reference library (libpng)

\e{Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG specification, as a way
of reducing the amount of time and effort it takes to support the PNG
file format in application programs.} -- quoted from \c
3rdparty/libpng/libpng.txt.


See \c 3rdparty/libpng/LICENSE for license details.


\section1 Data compression library (zlib)

\e{zlib is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code
is thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described
by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952} -- quoted from \c
3rdparty/zlib/README.

See \c 3rdparty/zlib/README for license details.
