\title Porting to Qt 3.x

<p>
You're probably looking at this page because you want to port
your application from Qt 2.x to Qt 3.x, but to be sure, let's
review the good reasons to do this:
<ul>
 <li>###
</ul>

<p>
The Qt 3.x series is not binary compatible with the 2.x series.
This means programs compiled for Qt 2.x must be recompiled to work
with Qt 3.x.  Qt 3.x is also not completely <em>source</em> compatible
with 2.x, however all points of incompatibility cause
compiler errors (rather than mysterious results), or produce run-time
messages.  The result is that Qt 3.x includes many additional features,
discards obsolete functionality that is easily converted to use the new
features, and that porting an application from Qt 2.x to Qt 3.x is
a simple task well worth the amount of effort required.


To port code using Qt 2.x to use Qt 3.x:

<ul>
 <li> Briefly read the porting notes below to get an idea of what to expect.
 <li> Be sure your code compiles and runs well on all your target platforms
        with Qt 2.x.
 <li> Recompile with Qt 3.x.  For each error, search below for related
	identifiers (eg. function names, class names) - this documented is
	structured to mention all relevant identifiers to facilitate such
	searching, even if that makes it a little verbose.
 <li> If you get stuck, ask on the qt-interest mailing list, or
	Trolltech Technical Support if you're a Professional Edition
	licensee.
</ul>


Many very major projects, such as ###
have been port, so there is plenty of expertise in the collective conscious
that is the Qt Developer Community!

<hr>

<h3><a name="Namespace">Namespace</a></h3>

<p> Qt 3.x is namespace-clean.  A few global identifiers that have been
left in Qt 2.x have been discarded.  Enumaration <code>QCursorShape</code>
and it values <code>ArrowCursor</code>, <code>UpArrowCursor</code>,
<code>CrossCursor</code>, <code>WaitCursor</code>, etc. are now part of the
special <code>Qt</code> class defined in qnamespace.h.


<h3><a name="Renamed">Removed functions</a></h3>

All <a href="removed30.html">these functions</a> have been removed in Qt 3.x.
<ul>
    <li>QWidget::setFontPropagation, QWidget::setPalettePropagation
    <li>QMenuBar::setActItem, QMenuBar::setWindowsAltMode
    <li>QCheckListItem::paintBranches
</ul>
