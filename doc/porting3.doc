\title Porting to Qt 3.x

<p>
You're probably looking at this page because you want to port
your application from Qt 2.x to Qt 3.x, but to be sure, let's
review the good reasons to do this:
<ul>
 <li>###
</ul>

<p>
The Qt 3.x series is not binary compatible with the 2.x series.
This means programs compiled for Qt 2.x must be recompiled to work
with Qt 3.x.  Qt 3.x is also not completely <em>source</em> compatible
with 2.x, however all points of incompatibility cause
compiler errors (rather than mysterious results), or produce run-time
messages.  The result is that Qt 3.x includes many additional features,
discards obsolete functionality that is easily converted to use the new
features, and that porting an application from Qt 2.x to Qt 3.x is
a simple task well worth the amount of effort required.


To port code using Qt 2.x to use Qt 3.x:

<ol>
 <li> Briefly read the porting notes below to get an idea of what to expect.
 <li> Be sure your code compiles and runs well on all your target platforms
        with Qt 2.x.
 <li> Recompile with Qt 3.x.  For each error, search below for related
	identifiers (eg. function names, class names) - this documented is
	structured to mention all relevant identifiers to facilitate such
	searching, even if that makes it a little verbose.
 <li> If you get stuck, ask on the qt-interest mailing list, or
	Trolltech Technical Support if you're a Professional Edition
	licensee.
</ol>


Many very major projects, such as ###
have been ported, so there is plenty of expertise in the collective conscious
that is the Qt Developer Community!

<h3><a name="Headers">Header file inclusion changes</a></h3>

<p> Qt 3.x remove some unnecessary nested #include directives from
header files. This speeds up compilation when you don't need those
nested header files. But in some cases you will find you need to add
an extra #include to your files.

<p> For example, if you get a message about QStringList or its functions
not being defined, then add <code>#include &lt;qstringlist.h&gt;</code> at
the top of the file giving the error.

<p> Header files that you might need to add #include directives for include:
<ul>
    <li><code>&lt;qcursor.h&gt;</code>
    <li><code>&lt;qregexp.h&gt;</code>
    <li><code>&lt;qpainter.h&gt;</code>
    <li><code>&lt;qstringlist.h&gt;</code>
    <li><code>&lt;qstrlist.h&gt;</code>
    <li><code>&lt;qvaluelist.h&gt;</code>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Namespace">Namespace</a></h3>

<p> Qt 3.x is namespace-clean.  A few global identifiers that had been
left in Qt 2.x have been discarded.

<p> Enumeration <code>QCursorShape</code> and it values are now part of the
special <code>Qt</code> class defined in qnamespace.h. If you get compilation
errors about these being missing (unlikely, since most of your code will
be in classes that inherit from the Qt namespace class), then change:

<ul>
    <li><code>QCursorShape</code> becomes <code>Qt::CursorShape</code>
    <li><code>ArrowCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::ArrowCursor</code>
    <li><code>UpArrowCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::UpArrowCursor</code>
    <li><code>CrossCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::CrossCursor</code>
    <li><code>WaitCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::WaitCursor</code>
    <li><code>IbeamCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::IbeamCursor</code>
    <li><code>SizeVerCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::SizeVerCursor</code>
    <li><code>SizeHorCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::SizeHorCursor</code>
    <li><code>SizeBDiagCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::SizeBDiagCursor</code>
    <li><code>SizeFDiagCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::SizeFDiagCursor</code>
    <li><code>SizeAllCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::SizeAllCursor</code>
    <li><code>BlankCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::BlankCursor</code>
    <li><code>SplitVCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::SplitVCursor</code>
    <li><code>SplitHCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::SplitHCursor</code>
    <li><code>PointingHandCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::PointingHandCursor</code>
    <li><code>BitmapCursor</code> becomes <code>Qt::BitmapCursor</code>
</ul>

<p> The name of some debugging macro variables has been changed.  We have
tried not to break source compatibility as much as possible.  If you observe
error messages on the UNIX console or the Windows debugging stream that were
previously disabled, please check these macro variables:

<ul>
    <li><code>DEBUG</code> becomes <code>QT_DEBUG</code>
    <li><code>NO_DEBUG</code> becomes <code>QT_NO_DEBUG</code>
    <li><code>NO_CHECK</code> becomes <code>QT_NO_CHECK</code>
    <li><code>CHECK_STATE</code> becomes <code>QT_CHECK_STATE</code>
    <li><code>CHECK_RANGE</code> becomes <code>QT_CHECK_RANGE</code>
    <li><code>CHECK_NULL</code> becomes <code>QT_CHECK_NULL</code>
    <li><code>CHECK_MATH</code> becomes <code>QT_CHECK_MATH</code>
</ul>

<p> The name of some debugging macro functions has been changed as well
but source compatibility should not be affected if the macro variable
<code>QT_CLEAN_NAMESPACE</code> is not defined:

<ul>
    <li><code>ASSERT</code> becomes <code>Q_ASSERT</code>
    <li><code>CHECK_PTR</code> becomes <code>Q_CHECK_PTR</code>
</ul>

<p> For the record, undocumented macro variables that are not part of the API
have been changed:

<ul>
    <li><code>_OS_*_</code> becomes <code>Q_OS_*</code>
    <li><code>_WS_*_</code> becomes <code>Q_WS_*</code>
    <li><code>_CC_*_</code> becomes <code>Q_CC_*</code>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Removed">Removed functions</a></h3>

All <a href="removed30.html">these functions</a> have been removed in Qt 3.x.
<ul>
    <li>QWidget::setFontPropagation, QWidget::setPalettePropagation
    <li>QMenuBar::setActItem, QMenuBar::setWindowsAltMode
    <li>QCheckListItem::paintBranches
    <li>QString::visual, QString::basicDirection
    <li>QStyle::set...
</ul>

<h3><a name="QRegExp">QRegExp</a></h3>

The \l QRegExp class has been rewritten to support most of the features of Perl
regular expressions.  Both the regular expression syntax and the QRegExp
interface were modified.

Be also aware that <code>&lt;qregexp.h&gt;</code> is no longer included
automatically when you include <code>&lt;qstringlist.h&gt;</code>. See
<a href="#Headers">above</a> for details.  <!-- In Qt 3.0, qregexp.h has to
include qstringlist.h, so it's no good to have qstringlist.h include qregexp.h,
unless one wants to achieve an Escher effect. -->

<dl>
<p><dt><b>New special characters</b></dt>
<dd> There are five new special characters: <tt>(</tt>, <tt>)</tt>, <tt>{</tt>,
<tt>|</tt> and <tt>}</tt> (parentheses, braces and pipe).  When porting old
regular expressions, you have to add <tt>&#92;</tt> (backslash) in front of any
of these (actually, <tt>&#92;&#92;</tt> in C++ strings), unless it is already
there.

Example:  Old code like

\code
    QRegExp rx( "([0-9|]*\\)" );        // works in Qt 2.x
\endcode

should be converted into

\code
    QRegExp rx( "\\([0-9]\\|]*\\)" );   // works in Qt 2.x and 3.x
\endcode

However, wildcard patterns need no conversion.  Here are two examples:

\code
    QRegExp wild( "(*.*)" );
    wild.setWildcard( TRUE );
\endcode

\code
    // TRUE as third argument means wildcard
    QRegExp wild( "(*.*)", FALSE, TRUE );
\endcode

Usually, QRegExp is easy to spot in programs.  However, in one unfortunate case,
it is subtle: as first argument to \l QString::replace().  Code like

\code
    QString text = fetch_it_from_somewhere();
    text.replace( QString("([^)]*)"), "" );
\endcode

involves an implicit QRegExp (namely, <code>"([^)]*)"</code>) that should be
changed.
</dd>

<p><dt><b>QRegExp& QRegExp::operator= ( const QString & pattern )</b></dt>
<dd>
This function has been replaced by \l QRegExp::setPattern() in Qt 2.2.  Old code
such as

\code
    QRegExp rx( "alpha" );
    rx.setCaseSensitive( FALSE );
    rx.setWildcard( TRUE );
    rx = "beta";
\endcode

still compiles with Qt 3, but produces a different result (the case sensitivity
and wildcard options are forgotten).  This way,
\code
    rx = "beta";
\endcode

is the same as
\code
    rx = QRegExp( "beta" );
\endcode

which is what one would expect.

</dd>

<p><dt><b>bool QRegExp::match ( const QString & str, int index = 0,
    int * len = 0, bool indexIsStart = TRUE ) const</b></dt>
<dd>
This function has an unwieldy parameter list and a bad name.  If you see code
like

\code
    QString bigText = getBigText();
    QRegExp rx( "[Dd]og" );
    int index = rx.match( bigText );
\endcode

(where match() takes one argument), change it to use QRegExp::search():

\code
    QString bigText = getBigText();
    QRegExp rx( "[Dd]og" );
    int index = rx.search( bigText );
\endcode

There is now a method \l QRegExp::match( const QString& str ) and it
accomplishes something more fit for that name.

For ease of porting, the old QRegExp::match( const QString&, int, int *, bool )
is still available for those case where QRegExp::search() won't do.  Read its
documentation for how to implement the same functionality with the new
interface.
</dd>

<p><dt><b>int QRegExp::find ( const QString & str, int index )</b></dt>
<dd>
This function was removed, after a brief appearance in Qt 2.2.  Its name is
confusing.  Use \l QRegExp::search() or \l QString::find() instead.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="QTranslator">QTranslator</a></h3>

The \l QTranslator class was extended in Qt 2.2, and these extensions lead to a
new interface.  This interface is used mainly by translation tools (such as <a
href="http://www.trolltech.com/linguist/">Qt Linguist</a>).  For source
compatibility, no member function was effectively removed.  The \l QTranslator
documentation points out which functions are obsolete.

However, the following function is no longer virtual:

<dl>
<p><dt><b>QString QTranslator::find ( const char * context,
    const char * sourceText ) const</b></dt>
<dd>
If you have a class that inherits QTranslator and that reimplements
QTranslator::find(), you should reimplement QTranslator::findMessage() instead.
In fact, find() is now defined in terms of findMessage().  By doing the
conversion, you will also gain support for translator comments and for any
future extension.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="Bezier">Bezier Curves</a></h3>
The function names for Bezier curves in <code>QPainter</code> and
<code>QPointArray</code> have been corrected. They now properly reflect their
cubic form instead of a quadratic one. If you have been using either
<code>QPainter::drawQuadBezier()</code> or
<code>QPointArray::quadBezier()</code> you will have to replace these calls
with
<ul>
 <li>void QPainter::drawCubicBezier( const QPointArray &, int index=0 ) and
 <li>QPointArray QPointArray::cubicBezier() const
</ul>
respectively. Neither the arguments nor the resulting curve have changed.

// warwick can regenerate this with his qt-2-report

<h3><a name="QMultiLineEdit">QMultiLineEdit</a></h3>

The QMultiLineEdit was a simple editor widget in former Qt
versions. Since Qt 3.0, which comes with a new richtext engine,
which also supports editing, QMultiLineEdit is obsolete. It is still
included for compatibility reasons. It is now a subclass of
QTextEdit which wrappes the old QMultiLineEdit so that it is mostly
source compatible to keep old applications working.

If you implement something new with QMultiLineEdit, rather use
QTextEdit instead.

Although most of the old QMultiLineEdit API is still available,
there is one important difference. Because of a design flaw of the
old QMultiLineEdit it operated on lines and not on paragraphs. As
lines do change all the time during wordwrap, the new richtext
engine only knows paragraphs as elements in the data structure. So
all functions (like numLines(), textLine()), which worked on lines,
now work on paragraphs.

Also the function getString() has been removed as this one published
the internal data structure.

So, applications which made normal usage of the QMultiLineEdit,
should keep working without problems. Programs which did some
special stuff with it might require some porting.
