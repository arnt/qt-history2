  * why isn't QStyleOptionFrame(int version) marked as internal?
  * replace QString with String, etc.
  * nested classes
  * enum_1

  * fix stylesheet
  * no link to class itself
  * support \ifjava
  * add // C++
  * support Java-only /*! ... */ comments

  * links to property names have to be fixed
        * example: version 1 in QStyleOptionFrame
        * example: foo -> isFoo()

  * lowercase, and remove final stop, in \brief texts for variables and properties
