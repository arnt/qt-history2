From Jasmin:

  * put images in "/images"
  * implement \target and \keyword
  * expand QObjectList -> QList<QObject *>
  * Drop return type in "List of all members" pages.
  * \enum Qt::ScrollBarPolicy (qviewport.cpp contains documentation for  \enum Qt::ScrollBarPolicy, and it 
  does show up in the docs, but not as a link from the properties in QViewport)
  * qhboxwidget.html#sizeHint is broken (apparently)

  * support <qglobal.h>'s typedefs with \typedef (qglobal.qdoc)
  * fix \value (e.g. Qt::BitmapCursor in qcursor.cpp)

  * Show in which module/library each class is
  * fix automatic links in \sectionX (e.g. qt4-getting-started.html)
  * fix resolving \typedef Qt::HANDLE
  * make links within document work
  * make links beyond document work

  * make \macro work (?)
  * many broken links, e.g. "See also QFrame::style()" at the end of QFrame's detailed description
  * add some magic for properties in \sa's?
  * turn \c into links?
  * warning for unnamed parameters in property access functions
  * \center...\endcenter

LINKS:
  * make types be links in Detailed synopses
  * make automatic links to function in text work
  * make automatic links in code work

  * explanation following nonstandard wording warning

  * omit \overload in operator<< and operator>>
  * make operator-() unary and binary independent functions (no \overload)
  * remove warning for undocumented enum item like QLocale::LastLanguage
  * improve the \a warnings for overloads; if one overload documents a para, fine

  * get rid of spurious 'global' functions

  * implement \sidebar

  * implement \inmodule
  * implement qbook
  * implement \stl

  * implement \legalesefile

  * show in which module each class is
  * list namespaces, list header files


NICE FEATURES:
  * implement inheritance tree for each class (as a PNG)
  * avoid <p>...</p> in table/item cells without relying on horrible kludge
  * prevent macros from having same name as commands
  * be smart about enum types Foo::Bar vs. Bar when comparing functions
  * be smart about const & non-const when comparing functions

OTHER:
  * make qdoc run faster
  * \annotated: specify which library
  * make sure \headerfile works even if specified after \relates

  * use qtstyle.css instead of inline style for each page
