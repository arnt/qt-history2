/*
 * delta.c -- Generate in streaming mode an rsync delta given a set of
 * signatures, and a new file.
 *
 * The size of blocks for signature generation is determined by the
 * block size in the incoming signature.
 *
 * To calculate a signature, we need to be able to see at least one
 * block of the new file at a time.  Once we have that, we calculate
 * its weak signature, and see if there is any block in the signature
 * hash table that has the same weak sum.  If there is one, then we
 * also compute the strong sum of the new block, and cross check that.
 * If they're the same, then we can assume we have a match.
 *
 * The final block of the file has to be handled a little differently,
 * because it may be a short match.  Short blocks in the signature
 * don't include their length -- we just allow for the final short
 * block of the file to match any block in the signature, and if they
 * have the same checksum we assume they must have the same length.
 * Therefore, when we emit a COPY command, we have to send it with a
 * length that is the same as the block matched, and not the block
 * length from the signature.
 */

/*
 * Profiling results as of v1.26, 2001-03-18:
 *
 * If everything matches, then we spend almost all our time in
 * rs_mdfour64 and rs_weak_sum, which is unavoidable and therefore a
 * good profile.
 *
 * If nothing matches, it is not so good.
