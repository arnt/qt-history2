<h1>The Q Window System Protocol</h1>

The <tt>qws</tt> server is a very simple window system. The objective is to make
a very small server, leaving the client libraries to do most of the work. This
architecture is well-suited to embedded systems as it allows for both small and
large client-server systems: for example a system that is initially just
<tt>qws</tt> and a few small clients can later have more clients added using
possibly more sophisticated client libraries.
<p>
The protocol used by QWS is documented in the sections below.

<h2>Client Initialization</h2>

When a client first runs, it makes a socket connection to port QWS_PORT (17986)
of the localhost.
All communication is on the local machine so no endianness considerations are
required for the data transfers.  The client first reads a header from the
socket:
<dl compact>
    <dt><tt>int width</tt>
	<dd>The width of the screen in pixels.
    <dt><tt>int height</tt>
	<dd>The height of the screen in pixels.
    <dt><tt>int depth</tt>
	<dd>The depth of the screen in bits.
    <dt><tt>int shmid</tt>
	<dd>The shared-memory identifier for the memory address of the
	    frame buffer, or -1 if shared-memory is not used (see next field).
    <dt><tt>int fbid</tt>
	<dd>The Linux framebuffer number to use (if shmid is -1),
	    or -1 if a framebuffer number is not used.
	    eg. 0 means use <tt>/dev/fb0</tt> as the framebuffer.
</dl>

<h2>Window Regions</h2>
<p>
The most important part of any window system is its handling of
<em>regions</em>. It is <em>regions</em> that are the window the user
sees.
<p>
The diagram below models a typical window system.
<p>
<img src=windows.gif>
<p>
First notice that there is a well-defined
order or "depth" for each window - following the labels alphabetically
from "a" the deepest to "g" the shallowest.
The window "a" is the
display screen or "root window".
The green windows "b", "c", and "g" are sub-windows of the root window and
are called "top level windows".
The yellow windows "f" and "d" are child windows of window "c", and "e"
is a child window of "d".
Note that window "d" is positioned so that its bottom portion is clipped
off by its parent window "c".
<p>
In QWS,
top level windows may all be controlled by
different processes, while
child windows are always controlled by the same process as the top level
window containing them.
<p>
Each of the coloured shapes is a window, and for each one there are three
regions of interest.
<p>
<img src=regions.gif>
<p>
<dl compact>
 <dt><b>requestedRegion</b>
    <dd>This is the region that is the shape of the window.
	    Non-rectangular windows such as "d" above
	    are called "shaped windows". QWS makes no distinction
	    between rectangular and non-rectangular windows.
 <dt><b>allocatedRegion</b>
    <dd>This is the requestedRegion intersected with allocatedRegion of
	    the parent window, minus the requestedRegion of any shallower
	    sibling windows. It represents the region allocated to a window
	    and all that windows children.
 <dt><b>paintableRegion</b>
    <dd>This is the region which the window is responsible for painting.
	    It is the allocatedRegion minus the requestedRegion of all
	    immediate child windows.
</dl>
Note that these regions are all relative to the root window, not to the
parent of the window.

<p>
In QWS, the server only handles the root and top-level windows, with
deeper child windows completely handled by the client library. This allows
operations that do not involve changes to the top-level window regions
to be faster.
<p>
When an application needs to change the region of a child window, it does so
without interaction with the server. When it needs to change the region of
a top-level window, it makes a request to the server which then negotiates
space for the window, possibly by taking space away from windows of other
applications. This is the <em>window management</em> feature of the server.

<h2>Events to Clients</h2>
<p>
After initialization, the client then continues with application-specific
processing, regularly
draining any events from the socket connection. The client will usually be
structured as an event loop.
The possible events are:
<dl>
  <dt>QWSMouseEvent
    <dd>
    <pre>
    int type = QWSEvent::Mouse;
    int dummy_windowid;
    int x_root, y_root, state;
    int time;</pre>
    This event is sent to the client whenever the mouse moves. All clients
    <font color=red>[this may change]</font>
    get all mouse events.
    The position (<i>x_root</i>, <i>y_root</i>)
    is relative to the top-left corner of the screen. <i>time</i> is a value
    in milliseconds that indicates when (relative to some undefined epoch) the
    mouse event occurred, and should be used by the client to calculate such
    emergent events as double-clicks.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSFocusEvent
    <dd>
    <pre>
    int type = QWSEvent::Focus;
    int windowid;
    uchar get_focus; </pre>
    If <i>get_focus</i> is 1, this indicates that <i>window</i> now has keyboard
    focus.  If <i>get_focus</i> is 0, this indicates that <i>window</i> no longer
    has keyboard focus.
    <font color=red>[we don't currently define when this happens]</font>
    </p>
  <dt>QWSKeyEvent
    <dd>
    <pre>
    int type = QWSEvent::Key;
    int windowid;
    int unicode;
    int modifiers;
    uint is_press:1;
    uint is_auto_repeat:1; </pre>
    This event is sent to the client whenever a key is pressed, released, or is
    auto-repeating after it is pressed.
    The key event <i>unicode</i> and <i>modifiers</i> values should be
    interpretted as if generated by the QWS
    <a href=#vkb>Virtual Keyboard</a>. If <i>is_press</i> is 1 then the user has
    pressed the key.  If <i>is_press</i> is 0 then the user has released the key.
    If <i>is_auto_repeat</i> is 1 then <i>is_press</i> is 1 and some time has
    passed since the key was pressed. <i>windowid</i> is redundant as it will
    always be the identifier of the window which most recently received focus.
    All clients <font color=red>[this may change]</font> get this message.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSRegionAddEvent
    <dd>
    <pre>
    int type = QWSEvent::RegionAdd;
    int windowid;
    int nrectangles;
    struct {
	int x, y, width, height;
    } rectangles[nrectangles]; </pre>
    This event is sent to the client whenever rectangles are added to
    the allocated region of the window.
    These events are also called "exposure" or "paint" events in other window
    systems, as the client is responsible for painting the new area.
    <p>
    The <i>rectangles</i> are in <a href=#yxbanded>YXBanded</a> format.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSRegionRemoveEvent
    <dd>
    <pre>
    int type = QWSEvent::RegionRemove;
    int windowid;
    int eventid;
    int nrectangles;
    struct {
	int x, y, width, height;
    } rectangles[nrectangles]; </pre>
    This event is sent to the client whenever the set of rectangles allocated
    to the window shrinks. The client must acknowledge receipt of this event
    as soon as possible by sending a QWSRegionAck command with the same
    <i>eventid</i>. Once acknowledged,,
    the client must not paint on the given rectangles.
    <p>
    The <i>rectangles</i> are in <a href=#yxbanded>YXBanded</a> format.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSCreationEvent
    <dd>
    <pre>
    int type = QWSEvent::Creation;
    int objectid;</pre>
    This event is sent to the client at some time after the client sends
    a QWSCreate command.
    </p>
</dl>

<h2>Commands from Clients</h2>

All simple commands have this basic structure:

<pre>
struct QWS&lt;Your&gt;Command : public QWSCommand {
    QWS&lt;Your&gt;Command() :
	QWSCommand( id_of_command, sizeof( simpleData ), (char*)&simpleData ) {}

    struct SimpleData {
        ...
    } simpleData;
};
</pre>

If you do not only have basic data types in the command, but also data
which size is not known form the beginning (like an array), a command looks
like this:

<pre>
struct QWS&lt;Your&gt;Command : public QWSCommand {
    QWS&lt;Your&gt;Command() :
	QWSCommand( id_of_command, sizeof( simpleData ), (char*)&simpleData ) {}

    void setData( char *d, int len, bool allocateMem = TRUE ) {
	QWSCommand::setData( d, len, allocateMem );
	arrayData = rawDataPtr;
    }

    struct SimpleData {
        ...
    } simpleData;

    struct ArrayData {
        ...
    } *arrayData;

};

Using this you can transfer arrays of any datatype (like char* and so on)
in commands.

</pre>

During processing, clients may send the following commands.

<dl>
  <dt>QWSCreateCommand
    <dd>
    Type: <i>QWSCommand::Create</i>
    <p>
    This command is sent by the client to create an object identifier.
    The client will
    eventually receive a QWSCreationEvent containing an identifier.
    Object identifiers are initially untyped, but once the client uses
    an object identifier, such as for a window identifier, it cannot
    be reused for other purposes.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSDestroyCommand
    <dd>
    Type: <i>QWSCommand::Destroy</i>
    <pre>
    struct SimpleData {
        int objectid;
    } simleData;</pre>
    This command is sent by the client to destroy an object identifier,
    including any object (such as a window) so identified.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSRegionCommand
    <dd>
    Type: <i>QWSCommand::Region</i>
    <pre>
    struct SimpleData {
        int windowid;
        int nrectangles;
    } simpleData;
    struct Rectangle {
	int x, y, width, height;
    } rectangles[ simpleData.nrectangles ]; </pre>
    This command is sent by the client to request that the region covered by
    the window be changed to the given set of rectangles. Note that the client
    must not paint in the requested area immediately; instead, it should delay
    repainting until it receives a subsequent QWSRegionEvent event which will
    define the actual rectangles allocated to the window (which may be any
    subset of the requested pixels).
    <p>
    The <i>rectangles</i> must be in <a href=#yxbanded>YXBanded</a> format.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSAddPropertyCommand
    <dd>
    Type: <i>QWSCommand::AddProperty</i>
    <pre>
    struct SimpleData {
        int windowid, property;
    } simleData;</pre>
    This command is sent by the client to add a property identified by <i>property</i>
    on the window with the id <i>windowid</i>.
    </p>
  <dt>QWSSetPropertyCommand
    <dd>
    Type <i>QWSCommand::SetProperty</i>
    <pre>
    struct SimpleData {
        int windowid, property, mode;
    } simleData;
    char *data;</pre>
    This command is sent by the client to set a property identified by <i>property</i>
    on the window with the id <i>windowid</i>. The property has to be added first,
    if it doesn't exist already. <i>mode</i> can be one of
    <ul>
      <li><i>QWSProperty::PropReplace</i> - If the <i>property</i> already contains data, the new data is
      is replaced by the new one 
      <li><i>QWSProperty::PropPrepend</i> - If the <i>property</i> already contains data, the new data is
      is prepended 
      <li><i>QWSProperty::PropAppend</i> - If the <i>property</i> already contains data, the new data is
      is appended 
    </ul>
    </p>
  <dt>QWSRemovePropertyCommand
    <dd>
    Type: <i>QWSCommand::RemoveProperty</i>
    <pre>
    struct SimpleData {
        int windowid, property;
    } simleData;</pre>
    This command is sent by the client to remove the property identified by <i>property</i>
    from the window with the id <i>windowid</i>.
    </p>
</dl>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<a name=yxbanded><h3>YXBanded Rectangles Region Format</h3></a>

Regions of pixels in QWS are always specified in YXBanded format. This is a
list of rectangles for which the following rules hold:
<ol>
    <li>No rectangles intersect.
    <li>The rectangles are sorted by top edge first, then by left edge.
    <li>Every rectangle with the same top edge has the same bottom edge.
	    Each sublist of such rectangles is called a "band" containing
	    all rectangles with the same top edge.
    <li>No two rectangles in a band may be adjacent (they must be merge if
	this is the case).
    <li>No two adjacent bands may have exactly the same list of horizontal extents
	(they must be merged if this is the case).
</ol>
Any set of rectangles can be divided canonically into such a list of rectangles.

<a name=vkb><h3>The QWS Virtual Keyboard</h3></a>

Key events in QWS are specified as if they are generated by a huge keyboard that
is the union of all the world's keyboards and input methods. The keyboard has
a discreet key for all the Unicode characters. It has 6 "modifier" keys, only some
of which are valid for certain Unicode characters. The modifiers are:
<dl>
 <dt>LeftShift, RightShift, RightAlt
    <dd>Never valid with any Unicode character. (eg. you cannot try to distinguish
	"A", "a", "LeftShift+A", and "LeftShift+a" as four cases; for each of "a"
	and "A" the state of LeftShift should be ignored. Thus this modifier is
	only interesting as a key by itself.
 <dt>LeftControl, RightControl
    <dd>Only valid with Unicode characters above U001F.
 <dt>LeftAlt
    <dd>Valid with any Unicode character.
</dl>
When a modifier key is pressed or released, a QWSKeyEvent is sent with the
unicode field set to UFFFF (not a unicode character).
<p>
Every QWS server implementation provides some way to generate all distinct key
events, though only some will be "easy" to generate (eg. single key presses),
and this will vary from one locale to another.
