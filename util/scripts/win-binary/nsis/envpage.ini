Text=Warning:\r\nEnabling this option makes the installer change settings in your registry. If you don't want to set these variables automatically, the installer provides a qtvars.bat file which sets the required variables. There is also a shortcut, located in your Qt start menu folder, that opens a Qt environment. The installer will try to remove any existing Qt environment variables if found.
