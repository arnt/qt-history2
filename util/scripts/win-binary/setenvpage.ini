Text=Warning:\r\nEnabling this options makes the installer change settings in your registry, or autoexec.bat file. If you don't want to set these variables automatically, the installer provides a qtvars.bat file which sets the required variables. There is also a shortcut, located in your Qt start menu folder, that opens a Qt environment. Also be sure that there are now Qt installations already in your path.
