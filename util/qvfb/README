Qt/Embedded Virtual Framebuffer
===============================

The virtual frame buffer allows a Qt/Embedded program to be developed on your
desktop machine, without switching between consoles and X11.  The virtual
framebuffer consists of a shared memory region (the virtual frame buffer)
and a utility to display the framebuffer in a window.  The display is updated
periodically, so you will see discrete snapshots of the framebuffer rather
than each individual drawing operation.  For this reason drawing problems
such as flickering may not be apparent until the program is run using a real
framebuffer.

To use the virtual framebuffer:

1. Set QT_FEATURE_QWS_VFB in $QTDIR/src/tools/qfeature.h and compile the
   Qt/Embedded library.
2. Start qvfb (qvfb should be compiled as a normal Qt/X11 application).
3. Start a Qt/Embedded server (i.e. construct QApplication with
   QApplication::GuiServer flag).

qvfb supports the following command line options:

[-width width]   the width of the virtual framebuffer (default: 240).
[-height height] the height of the virtual framebuffer (default: 320).
[-depth depth]   the depth of the virtual framebuffer (8 or 32, default: 8).
[-nocursor]      do not display the X11 cursor in the framebuffer window.

The virtual framebuffer is a development tool only.  No security issues have
been considered in the virtual framebuffer design.  It should not be used
in a production environment and QT_FEATURE_QWS_VFB should always be disabled
in production libraries.
