<h1>Demo for composition modes</h1>

<p>This demo shows some more advanced composition modes that are supported by Qt.
The two most common form of composition are <b>Source</b> which is used
whenever an opaque object is drawn. In this mode, each pixel in the source replace the corresponding
pixel in the destination. Another common operation is <b>SourceOver</b> in which the source object
is transparent and is drawn on top of the destination.</p>

<p>In addition to these standard modes, Qt defines the complete set of composition modes
as defined by X. Porter and Y. Duff. See the documentation of <code>QPainter</code> for
details.</p>
