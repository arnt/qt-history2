1.01a -

 New system for library linking. This system allows a user several different features:

 1) libtool like library dependancies to static libraries build with qmake
 2) library dependencies, when on .pro depends on another library - it will
    automatically build that other library (unix makefiles only)
 3) automatic detection of configurations for Qt, if CONFIG qt is specified
    it will find the settings for the most recent Qt itself.

 Project Builder for Mac OS X is now a supported backend for qmake.

 qmake now offers a 'make uninstall' feature, to reverse the actions of a 'make install'.

 qmake can now do recursive searches in project-file mode (-r option).

1.00a -

 First release, shipped with Qt 3.0.

 qmake ships with support for Unix make, MSVC (both dsp and nmake), Borland make, and
 CodeWarrior 7.0 for Mac OS X.
