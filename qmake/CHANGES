 New system for library linking. This system allows a user several different features:

 1) libtool like library dependancies to static libraries build with qmake
 2) library dependencies, when on .pro depends on another library - it will
    automatically build that other library (unix makefiles only)
 3) automatic detection of configurations for Qt, if CONFIG qt is specified
    it will find the settings for the most recent Qt itself.

 Project Builder for Mac OS X is now a supported backend for qmake.
