Qt 3.0.2 is a bugfix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 3.0.1


****************************************************************************
*			    General					   *
****************************************************************************

- Improved build on SCO OpenServer 5.0.5, Sun WorkShop 4.2, MIPSpro 7.2

- Bidi on X11: direction key events for right-to-left are configurable
in QSettings via qt/useRtlExtensions. In 3.0.1 they were always turned
on.

- basic table support with XFree86

- unicode on X11: fix keysymbols 0x1000000-0x100ffff

*			   Library					   *
****************************************************************************

- QAbstractLayout
	Fixes for heightToWidth handling

- QDataTable	
	Faster key event handling. Fixed crash when cancelling cell
	editing.

- QDateEdit
	Gray out background if the widget is disabled. Fixed small
	static memory leak on exit.

- QDialog
	On show(), send a tab-focus event to the focus widget, so that
	e.g. lineedits select all when becoming visible.

-QDockWindow
	Use correct minimum size, taking frame into account. Less
	flicker on (de)activation.

- QFileDialog
	win32 only: In getExistingDirectory(), use QFileDialog and not
	the Windows system one when the dirOnly flag is FALSE

- QFont
	win32 only: Fixed boundingBox() when called in a widget
	constructor. Internal fixes for invalid HDCs. More
	accurate exactMatch()

- QGLWidget
	x11 only: fixed shared OpenGL display lists

- QGroupBox
	More predictable focus handling

- QImage
	Fixed xForm() for bigendian bitmaps

-QLabel
	Smarter minimumSizeHint() for word-break labels

- QLayout
	Fixed possible crash when deleting/adding layout items. More
	robut on runtime layout changes.

- QLineEdit
	Ctrl-V now calls the virtual paste() rather than duplicating
	its functionality. Override accelerators for keypad keys.

- QListBox
	When inserting items, make sure that we set the head item to selected,
	since QListBox::currentItem returns 0, but
	QListBox::item(0)->isSelected() returns FALSE. Make
	itemVisible() mroe robust with deferred layouts

- QListView
	Fix focus rects for QCheckList items that have a Controller as
	a parent. Also, fix drawing of selected checklist boxes so
	that the focus rect doesn't overlap it. Keep checklist items
	working after the user swapped columns

- QMenuBar
	mostly X11: when the focus widget is unfocused, the menubar
	should stop waiting for an alt release.  On X11, when you use
	an alt-key shortcut to switch desktops back and forth, then
	you will get the menubar in altmode when you return to that
	desktop

- QMovie
	Animated gifs with a frame delay of 0 work nicer

- QODBCResult
	Fixed isNull() for some cases

- QPopupMenu
	More fixes for the animate and fade effects

- QPixmap
	Make grabWidget() work with internally doublebuffered widgets

- QScrollBar
	Make sure middle clicking a scrollbar doesn't allow the slider
	to move outside the groove

- QSettings
	In readEntry(), report 'ok' in all cases.  Make sure the
	default value is returned correctly for bool entries that
	do not exist in the settings files. Both readNumEntry()
	and readDoubleEntry() report a false ok parameter if the
	conversion fails

- QSgiStyle
	Minor visual improvements

- QSlider
	Make setting a new size policy in designer work

- QSqlRecord
	Fixed crash when accessing values of non-existing fields

- QString
	mid() works savely now for len > length() && len != 0xffffffff

- QTable
	Use correct style flags for QCheckTableItem drawing. The
	internal event filter no longer consumes FocusIn/FocusOut,
	meaning those events are accessible for subclasses now

- QTextCode
	Support for @euro locales

- QTextEdit
	The internal event filter no longer consumes FocusIn/FocusOut,
	meaning those events are accessible for subclasses
	now. Override accelerators for keypad keys. Reduced memory
	consumption for contents with many paragraphs. Emit
	selectionChanged() when the selected text has been
	removed. Emitting the linkClicked() signal may result in the
	cursor overing over a new, valid link - check this and set the
	appropriate cursor shape

- QToolTip
	Fixed wordbreaking when using both rich text and plain text
	tooltips

- QVariant
	In toDateTime(), allow conversion from QDate

- QWhatsThis
	X11 only: Fixed positioning on dualhead setups

- QWidget
	X11 only:  fixed a show() problem that occured
	after few reparents from and to toplevel

- QWindowsStyle
	Minor visual improvements (popupmenu checkitems, listview branches)

- QWorkspace
	Obey minimumSizeHint() of document widgets. Do not emit
	windowActivated() for the already active document window.
