Changes in Qt 2.1.0
-------------------

Qt 2.1.0 is a minor release, backward compatible with all Qt 2.x releases.
This release has additional features and bugfixes. Some bugfixes may cause
differences in runtime behaviour - such fixes are marked with a "*".  


New features
------------

Support for legacy Motif Drag-and-drop.
Support for Big5 character encoding.


General improvements
--------------------

* qRgb(r,g,b) now sets an alpha value of 0xff instead of 0x00.  Users
want an opaque value by default, not a transparent one.  However this
may have some impact on client code that handles pixel values directly.


Windows-specific fixes
----------------------

None.


X11-specific fixes
------------------

* QPainter::drawPolygon() no longer draws an outline in brush color if
NoPen is specified.  This matches the behaviour on Windows and ensures
that the area painted in this case is the same pixels defined by
a QRegion made from a polygon. To get the old behaviour, you can call
painter.setPen(painter.brush()) prior to painting (which will also work
on Windows).
