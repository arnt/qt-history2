Qt 4.2 introduces many new features as well as many improvements and
bugfixes over the 4.1.x series. For more details, see the online
documentation which is included in this distribution. The
documentation is also available at http://doc.trolltech.com/

The Qt version 4.2 series is binary compatible with the 4.1.x series.
Applications compiled for 4.1 will continue to run with 4.2.

- Added the QtDBus module to provide inter-process communication on platforms
  that support the D-BUS protocol.

- Dropped support for MySQL version 3.

  ascii to unicode conversion when set. Only works if the compiler supports
  deprecated API warnings.

- Added Q_REQUIRED_RESULT to some functions. This macro triggers a warning
  if the result of a function is discarded. Currently only supported by gcc.

- Added QDataWidgetMapper class that can be used to make widgets data aware
  by mapping them to sections of an item model.

- Added QDesktopServices class that can be used to open urls.

- Improved Accessibility for item-based views and QTextEdit.

- Designer
        Added QWidget and new widgets in this release to Designer's widget box.
        Updated dialog templates to use the new QDialogButtonBox class.
        Backup files created by Designer no longer overwrite existing files.
        Promoted widgets inherit the task menu items of the base class.
        Don't order enums alphabetically in the property editor.
        Fixed issue where shortcuts could be corrupted in certain situations.
        Line endings in .ui files now match the standard line endings for the
        platform the files are created on.
        Displays a warning whenever duplicate connections are made in the
        connections editor.
        Added shortcuts for the "Bring to Front" and "Send to Back" form
        editor actions.


- Designer, uic: Added support for more variant types:
  QStringList, QRectF, QSizeF, QPointF, QUrl, QChar, qlonglong and qulonglong.

- uic3: Add linenumbers to warnings. Make warnings know the objectName of the
  widget in question.
  QStandardItemModel API provides a classic item-based approach to
  working with models.

- lupdate and lrelease: Disable .qm file compression by default (pass
  -compress to obtain the old behavior). Make verbose the default
  behavior (pass -silent to obtain the old behavior).

- Added Qt::ForegroundRole and Qt::BackgroundRole, allowing itemviews to
  use any QBrush (not just QColor, as previously) when rendering items.

- Itemviews selections are maintained when the layout of the model changes
  (e.g. due to sorting).

- Itemviews convenience views can perform dynamic sorting of items
  when item data change.

- Added functions qrand() and qsrand() that provide thread safe rand() and srand().

- Added the Cleanlooks style for improved integration with GNOME based desktops.

- Added experimental support for Qt usage reporting ("metered licenses")
  on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Reporting is disabled by default.

- Plastique style has improved support for palettes, and now requires XRender
  support on X11 for alpha transparency.

  native look for Qt applications on GNOME.

- New tool: pixeltool is a screen magnification tool, designed to help with
  the process of fine-tuning styles and user interface features.

- Added support for reading and writing TIFF images.

- Tulip containers:
    Added typedefs for STL compatability.
    Added fucntion overloads to make the API easier to use.

- Porting
    qt3to4 now appends to the log file instead of overwriting it.
    Fix one case were qt3to4 was inserting unix-stlye line endings on Windows.
    New classes, Q3VGroupBox and Q3HGroupBox were added to ease porting.
    Updated the porting rules for this release.

- Added new key mapper system, which improves the shortcut system by only
  testing the real possible shortcuts, such as Ctrl+Shift+= and Ctrl++ on an
  English keyboard.


Build System
------------

Qt/X11, Qt/Mac and Qtopia Core only:

Add all QT_NO_* defines to the buildkey.


Qt/X11 and Qtopia Core only:

As in Qt 3, the configure script enables the -release option by default,
causing the Qt libraries to be built with optimizations. If configured
with the -debug option, the debug builds no longer result in libraries
with the _debug suffix.

On modern systems flags are added to the Qt build to also generate debugging
information, which is then stored in a separate .debug file. The additional
debug information does not affect the performance of the optimized code and
tools like gdb and valgrind automatically pick up the separate .debug files.
This way it is possible to get useful backtraces even with release builds of
Qt.

Remove last vestiges of the module options in configure, previously they
were available but did not function.

Implement a -build option in configure to conditionally compile only
certain sections of Qt.

Make it possible to build Qt while having xcode set as your QMAKESPEC on OSX.


Windows only:

Populate the buildkey, as done on all the other platforms.
Fix dependency generation in Visual Studio Solutions (.sln) created by qmake.
Added missing platforms to the Visual Studio Project generator (X64, SH3DSP
and EBC).
Use a temporary file for too long commandlines for UIC3.
Avoid object file (.o) conflicts with MinGW when embedded a native resource
file which is named the same as a normal source file.
Fix mkspec detection when generating project files outside of QTDIR.

        the object was created before QApplication or in a non-QThread
        thread.

        When QObject::thread() is zero, events are no longer sent to
        the object (Previous versions of Qt would send posted events
        to objects with no thread; this does not happen anymore in Qt
        4.2).

- QThread
        Related to the above, QThread::currentThread() always returns

        Now uses an internal buffer when opened in buffered mode, which
        improves reading performance significantly.

        Some behavioral differences have been introduced: the following
        functions now need to call the base implementation when reimplemented:

        QIODevice::atEnd()
        QIODevice::bytesAvailable()
