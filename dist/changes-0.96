Here is a list of (major) changes in Qt from 0.95 to 0.96.

Bug-fixes, optimizations and much improved documentation, of course.

There are few changes in the API (Qt header files).  Some functions have
been renamed or the arguments have changed.  We keep the old functions
until the next release.  Compile with -DOBSOLETE to allow calls to the
obsolete functions.


qglobal.h:
----------
  INT32 and UINT32 typedefs changed to work with DEC Alpha.


QBitmap:
--------
  Constructor takes "const uchar *bits" instead of "const char *"
  because of sign problems (uchar = unsigned char).


QButton:
--------
  toggleButton() is obsolete, renamed to isToggleButton().


QButtonGroup:
-------------
  Exclusive group setting added (isExclusive and setExclusive).


QDataStream:
-----------
  Removed serialization of int and uint. Doesn't work anymore when
  INT32 and UINT32 are int and uint.


QWidget:
--------
  New protected virtual functions styleChange(), backgroundColorChange(),
  backgroundPixmapChange(), paletteChange() and fontChange().
  These functions are called from setStyle(), setBackgroundColor() etc.
  You can reimplement them to if you need to know when widget properties
  changed and to optimize updates.
