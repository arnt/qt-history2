Here is a list of (major) changes in Qt from 0.95 to 0.96.

Bug-fixes, optimizations and much improved documentation, of course.

There are few changes in the API (Qt header files).


QBitmap:
--------
  Constructor takes "const uchar *bits" instead of "const char *"
  because of sign problems (uchar = unsigned char).


QWidget:
--------
  New protected virtual functions styleChange(), backgroundColorChange(),
  backgroundPixmapChange(), paletteChange() and fontChange().
  These functions are called from setStyle(), setBackgroundColor() etc.
  You can reimplement them to if you need to know when widget properties
  changed and to optimize updates.
