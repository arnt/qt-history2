Getting Started with Qt Evaluation for Windows
==============================================

When you install the Qt Evaluation version, you get a prebuilt Qt
library which is time-limited to work for 31 days.


Build the Qt Example Programs
-----------------------------

The setup program created a Qt folder in "Start menu -> Programs".
This folder contains two shortcuts to build the example programs
and the tutorial (unless you chose to not install them).  Run
these shortcuts to build the example programs or tutorial.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If the compilation fails because the moc.exe program cannot be found or
the Qt header files are missing, check if the PATH contains the qt\bin
directory and the environment variable QTDIR has been set.  After
installing Qt, you may need to reboot your computer to make sure these
settings are applied.

If the compilation fails because the compiler does not find the system
header files (e.g. stdio.h or windows.h), you must set the INCLUDE and LIB
environment variables to contain the paths of the compiler's header files
and library files.  For Microsoft Visual C++ users, run the vcvars32.bat
file to setup the environment.


The Qt Reference Manual
-----------------------

The Qt reference documentation is installed in the qt\html directory
(unless you chose not to install it.)  The Qt folder in "Start menu ->
Programs" contains a shortcut to browse the documentation.

If you are new to Qt programming, we recommend that you check out the
tutorial section and the example programs.  It may also be a good idea
to get hold of the "Programming with Qt" book published by O'Reilly
(ISBN 1-56592-588-2), which covers elementary to advanced topics in
Qt programming.

The documentation is also available as postscript from

Create Makefiles with Tmake
---------------------------

If you want to spend less time writing your own makefiles or you need to
maintain makefiles for several platforms, download and install the free
tmake utility from Troll Tech.  tmake is an easy-to-use tool for creating
and maintaining makefiles across many platforms and compilers.

tmake reads a special tmake project file (.pro) and creates a makefile for
your operating system and compiler.  A project file typically looks like
this (qt\examples\hello\hello.pro):

      TEMPLATE  = app
      CONFIG    = qt warn_on release
      HEADERS   = hello.h
      SOURCES   = hello.cpp \
                  main.cpp
      TARGET    = hello

To create a makefile for Borland C++, set the TMAKEPATH environment
variable to "C:\tmake\lib\win32-borland" and run the tmake program:

      C:\qt\examples\hello> tmake hello.pro -o Makefile

tmake can create makefiles for Windows and all popular Unix systems and
supports more than 15 different C/C++ compilers and is therefore ideal
for cross-platform software development.  tmake can also create project
files (.dsp files) for Microsoft Developer Studio.
