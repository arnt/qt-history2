Installation instructions for Qt/Windows
========================================
To use the evaluation, you need to have Microsoft Visual C++ v.6, .NET or
Borland C++ v. 5.5 installed. In the Windows directory on this CD, you
will find two versions of the Qt/Windows evaluation package:

qt-win-eval-msvc-3.2.0.exe
qt-win-eval-borland-3.2.0.exe

If you want to use Qt with Microsoft Visual C++, select the "msvc"
package. Otherwise, select the "borland" package to use Qt with
Borland C++.

Start the installation by double-clicking on the package you have
selected and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. 

You will be asked to enter the following information:
Name:    Qt Evaluator
Company: CD
Serial:  <enter serial key printed on the back of the CD cover>

Note: all fields are case-sensitive!

Further installation help will be available in the release notes which 
will be shown at the end of the installation process.


Installation instructions for Qt/Mac
====================================
You will find the Qt/Mac evaluation version in the MacOS directory on 
this CD.

Start the installation by copying the qt-mac-eval-3.2.0.sit package to your
hard disk and then double-clicking it to unstuff it. Once it is unstuffed,
double-click the QtMac-Eval-3.2.0 application.

The installation wizard will ask you for the following information:
Name:    Qt Evaluator
Company: CD
Serial:  <enter serial key printed on the back of the CD cover>

Note: all fields are case-sensitive!

Before using the evaluation version, it is important that you follow 
the instructions in the README.txt file that will be copied to the directory 
you install the evalation version in.


Installation instructions for Qt/X11
====================================
In the Unix directory on this CD, you will find the Qt/X11 evaluation
package:

qt-x11-eval-3.2.0.tar

In a shell, cd to where you want to install the Qt/X11 evaluation, for
example your home directory. Then unpack the archive by giving the command

tar xf /cdrom/Unix/qt-x11-eval-3.2.0.tar

(replace "/cdrom" with the mount point of your CD-ROM drive). This will
create a directory called qt-x11-eval-3.2.0. Further installation
instructions are then available in the file qt-x11-eval-3.2.0/INSTALL.


Installation instructions for Qt/Embedded
=========================================
In the Embedded directory on this CD, you will find the Qt/Embedded 
evaluation packages:

qt-embedded-2.3.2-eval.tar
qt-embedded-eval-3.2.0.tar

In a shell, cd to where you want to install the Qt/X11 evaluation, for
example your home directory. Then unpack the archive by giving the command

tar xf /cdrom/Unix/qt-embedded-eval-2.3.2.tar
and/or:
tar xf /cdrom/Unix/qt-embedded-eval-3.2.0.tar

(replace "/cdrom" with the mount point of your CD-ROM drive). This will
create a directory called qt-embedded-eval-2.3.2 or qt-embedded-eval-3.2.0.
Further installation instructions are then available in the file 
qt-embedded-eval-2.3.2/INSTALL or qt-embedded-eval-3.2.0/INSTALL.

The Qt Reference Manual
=======================
The full Qt reference documentation in HTML format is included with this
evaluation version. You can read it using the Qt Assistant tool, which is
available from the Qt submenu on the Start menu. You can also read using 
any web browser. Start in the directory where you installed Qt, and navigate 
to doc/html/index.html. In the Windows environment the path to use would 
be file://localhost/c:/qt/3.2.0/doc/html/index.html

If you are new to Qt programming, we recommend that you check out the
tutorial section (see: http://doc.trolltech.com/3.2/how-to-learn-qt.html)
and the Qt Designer manual. We also suggest that you obtain a copy of 
one of the many books about Qt programming that are available. For further 
information, see:

http://www.trolltech.com/developer/documentation/literature.html
