Qt 3.2 introduces new features as well as many improvements over the
3.0.x series. This file gives an overview of the main changes since
version 3.1.2.  For further detail see the online documentation which
is included in this distribution, and also available on
http://doc.trolltech.com/

The Qt version 3.2 series is binary compatible with the 3.1.x series -
applications compiled for 3.1 will continue to run with 3.2.

Qt library
----------

Some new classes have been added to the Qt Library. Amongst them are a
class to add splash screens to applications (QSplashScreen), a toolbox
widget that provides a column of tabbed widgets (QToolBox), and a
class to manage per-thread data storage (QThreadStorage).

The SQL module received a fair bit of attention this time. The most
notable improvements are a native IBM DB2 driver, complete support for
stored procedures including the possibility to access out-parameters,
and native support for 64 bit fields without having to convert to or
from strings. We also added support for setting connection parameters.
This way you can e.g. conveniently open a SSL connection to a MySQL or
PostgreSQL database. If you need even more customization, e.g. for an
Oracle database, you you can setup the connection yourself and
instantiate a Qt driver object on top of it.  An extended SQL cursor
class has been added that makes it more convenient to display result
sets from general SQL queries (QSqlSelectCursor), and you can add
custom database drivers without compiling them as plugins (see
QSqlDatabase::registerSqlDriver()).

QLineEdit - the one-line text editor - now supports validation input
masks. The feature complements the previous QValidatorConcept and
allows e.g. to restrict input to the format of IP addresses (mask
"990.990.990.990;_"), or ISO dates (mask "0000-90-90;0").

Qt's unicode code support has been extended. Most notable full support
for Indic scripts has been added, covering writing systems like
Devanagari, Tamil and Bengali. The group of right to left writing
systems has been extended with support for Syriac. Both improvements
are available on both Windows with Uniscribe installed, and on
Unix/X11 when using XFT with OpenType fonts.

All tool classes that support STL-like iterators with begin() and
end() got two extra functions constBegin() and constEnd(). The const
versions always return const iterators, and thus can be a little bit
faster with Qt's implicitely shared containers.

QPainter's complex drawText() function has been highly
optimized. Despite its support for complex unicode scripts it now
performs better than its less unicode-capable counterpart in Qt 2.3.

QPixmap supports now pixmaps with alpha channel (semi transparency) on all
Windows versions except Windows 95 and Windows NT.

The print dialog now supports "selection" as print range as well as
the possibility to enable/disable all different printer options
individually.

Many classes were improved, see the detailed overview below.

Qt Motif Extension
------------------

Dialog handling has matured and been extended since the extension's
introduction in Qt 3.1.  The documentation and code examples have been
improved, including a walkthrough which covers the complete migration
of a real-world Motif example to Qt. The process contains four
intermediate steps where the application utilizes both toolkits.

ActiveQt Extension
------------------

Type handling has been extended on both the container and the server
side. New supported types are byte arrays and 64bit integers.
The QAxServer module supports QObject subclasses as return and parameter
types of slots, and allows error reporting through COM exceptions.
The Designer integration has been extended to support property dialogs 
implemented by the control server.

****************************************************************************
*			   Library					   *
****************************************************************************

- QAction / QActionGroup
	Simplified constructors; it no longer is necessary to specify
	texts for buttons and menu items separately.
	For action groups we fixed the enable/disable behaviour. If
	an action inside an action group is explicitly disabled, it is
	no longer implicitely enabled toghether with the group.
	This is identical to enabling/disabling widgets and their
	children.

- QApplication
	Added aboutQt() slot for convenience.

- QAssistentClient
	New function setArguments() to invoke Assistent in different
	modes.

- QAxBase
	New function asVariant() to pass a COM object through 
	dynamicCall().

- QAxBindable
	New function reportError() to send error information to the 
	ActiveX	client.

- QColor
	New static function colorNames() to retrieve a list of all
	color names known to Qt.

- QDeepCopy
	Now also supports QDir, QFileInfo and QStringList.

- QDom
	Long and ulong support for setAttribute() and
	setAttributeNS().

- QFont
	New properties stretch and overline. New function resolve()
	that copies unspecified attributes from one font to another.

- QFontDataBase
	New overload for families() that restricts the returned list
	to fonts supporting a specific QFont::Script,
	e.g. QFont::Greek, QFont::Devanagari or QFont::Arabic.

- QFontInfo / QFontMetrics
	New constructors that force the info and metrics objects
	to use a given QFont::Script.

- QHeader
	Added getters for the sort indicator (sortIndicatorSection()
	and sortIndicatorOrder() ).

- QImage
	New overload for save() that writes to a given QIODevice*.

- QListView
	Added tristate support to check list items
	(QCheckListItem::setTristate()). New functions
	setSelectionAnchor() to set the list view's selection anchor
	explicitely.

- QLineEdit
	Added support for input masks (setInputMask(), inputMask(),
	hasAcceptableInput()).

- QMessageBox
	New static function question() that complements the exisiting
	information(), warning() and fatal().

- QMotifDialog [Qt Motif Extension]
	Now has two distinct modes of operation: It allows a Motif
	dialog to have a Qt parent, and it allows a Qt dialog to have
	a Motif parent.

- QPixmapCache
	New function remove() to explicitely remove a pixmap from the
	cache.

- QPrinter
	New functions setPrintRange(), printRange(),
	setOptionEnabled() and optionEnabled().
	Windows only: new function setWinPageSize() that allows to set
	DEVMODE.dmPaperSize directly.

- QPtrList
	Added STL-like iterators with begin(), end() and erase().

- QScrollBar
	Maintains a user defined size policy when the direction
	changes.

- QSplashScreen [new]
	This new widget class provides a splash screen to be shown
	during application startup.

- QSplitter
	New properties opaqueResize, childrenCollapsible and
	handleWidth.

- QSqlSelectCursor [new]
	This new QSqlCursor subclass provides browsing of general SQL
	SELECT statements.

- QString
	Added 64 bit support. New functions multiArg(), reserve(),
	capacity(), squeeze(), and case insensitive overloads for
	startsWith() and endsWidth().

- QStringList
	New function gres().

- QStyle
	Added support for toolbox, header, MDI frame, table grid line
	color, line edit password character, message box question.

- QSyntaxHighlighter
	New function currentParagraph().

- QTabWidget
	Added support for custom widgets to be placed beside
	the tab bar (setCornerWidget() and cornerWidget()).

- QTextEdit
	In Log mode: new functions setMaxLogLines() and maxLogLines().

- QThreadStorage [new]
	This new tool class provides per-thread data storage, also
	referred to as thread local storage or TLS.

- QToolBox [new]
	This new widget class provides a column of tabbed widgets, one
	above the other, with the current page displayed below the
	current tab.

- QVariant
	Added support for LongLong and ULongLong.

- QWidget
	New widget flag WNoAutoErase (combines the now obsoleted
	WResizeNoErase and WRepaintNoErase flag)

- QWidgetContainerPlugin [new]
	This new plugin class complements QWidgetPlugin for custom
	container widgets, meaning widgets that can host child
	widgets.
