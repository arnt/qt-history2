This is general Qt/Mac guide, this will outline known issues:


MacOSX:

Threading is not supported. Carbon does not seem thread-safe todate and we will need to
investigate the threading manager more.

Applications *must* be run out of a bundle (something like widgets.app/). MacOSX needs this 
to dispatch events correctly, as well as gaining access to the menubar. If using GDB you must
run with the *full* path to the executable.
