Qt/Mac %VERSION% Release
--------------------

Due to long filenames, the release requires you to 
'untar' %UNPACK_NAME%. To do this you 
should drop to a Terminal (in Applications) and run:

cd Directory_You_Unpacked_To
%UNPACK_CMD% %UNPACK_NAME%

After this please see the INSTALL file for further 
documentation on properly installing Qt/Mac.

Please contect Trolltech support with any problems.
