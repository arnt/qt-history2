Qt/Mac %VERSION% Release
--------------------

Due to long filenames, the release requires you to 
'untar' %DISTNAME%.tar. To do this you 
should drop to a Terminal (in Applications) and run:

cd Directory_You_Unpacked_To
tar xvf %DISTNAME%.tar

After this please see the INSTALL file for further 
documentation on properly installing Qt/Mac.

Please contect Trolltech support with any problems.
