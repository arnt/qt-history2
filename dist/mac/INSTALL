			  INSTALLING Qt FOR MacOSX


You may need to be root, depending on the permissions of the directories
where you choose to install Qt.


1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /usr/local
	gunzip qt-mac-%VERSION%.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xf qt-mac-%VERSION%.tar	# unpack it

    This creates the directory /usr/local/qt-%VERSION% containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Rename qt-%VERSION% to qt (or make a symlink):

	mv %DISTDIR% qt

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /usr/local/qt.


2.  Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. (Create the
    file if it is not there already.)

	QTDIR		   - wherever you installed Qt
	PATH		   - to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	MANPATH 	   - to access the Qt man pages
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH  - for the shared Qt library

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:

	QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QTDIR PATH MANPATH DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

	setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
	setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

    After you have done this, you will need to login again, or
    re-source the profile before continuing, so that at least $QTDIR
    is set.  The installation will give an error message and not
    proceed otherwise.


3.  Install your license file as $HOME/.qt-license.
    For the free edition, you do not need a license file.  For Professional
    and Enterprise editions, install your license file as described in your
    distribution.


4.  Building.

    This step compiles the Qt library, and builds the example programs,
    the tutorial, and the tools (eg. the Designer).

    Type:

	./configure

    This will configure the Qt library for your machine. Note that
    GIF support is turned off by default. Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.

    To create the library and compile all examples and the tutorial:

	make

    If your platform or compiler is not supported, read PORTING.  If you
    have any compile problems, see http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/

    

5.  Installing.

    Once you have built all of Qt, you should be ready to use. However if
    you'd like to be able to double-click on your applications in the
    Finder, you must place the relevant libraries in a directory where it
    will look for them. At the moment, the recommendation is to:

    ln -s $QTDIR/lib/libqt.dylib.3.0.0 /usr/lib
    ln -s $QTDIR/lib/libqui.dylib.1.0.0 /usr/lib

    You may need to have 'administrator' access to do this, to gain this 
    access you may need to prefix the lines above with sudo, which will then
    prompt for a password.


That's all.  Qt is now installed. You will find all documentation for Qt in
$QTDIR/doc/html.
