			  INSTALLING Qt/Mac Version %VERSION% (for Mac OS X)


You may need to be logged in as root, depending on the permissions of
the directories where you choose to install Qt.


1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /usr/local
	gunzip qt-mac-%VERSION%.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xf qt-mac-%VERSION%.tar	# unpack it

    This creates the directory /usr/local/qt-%VERSION% containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Rename qt-%DISTNAME% to qt (or make a symlink):

	mv %DISTNAME% qt

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /usr/local/qt.


2.  Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. (Create the
    file if it is not there already.)

	QTDIR		   - wherever you installed Qt
	PATH		   - to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	MANPATH 	   - to access the Qt man pages
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH  - for the shared Qt library

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:

	QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QTDIR PATH MANPATH DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

	setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
	setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

        ***************************WARNING******************************
        * Some versions of tcsh do not understand the expansion of empty
        * variables. If you experience any error messages with the above
        * instructions, you may want to replace them with:
        *
	*  setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
	*  setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	*  setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man
	*  setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib

    After you have done this, you will need to login again, or
    re-source the profile before continuing.


3.  Install your license file as $HOME/.qt-license.
    For the free edition, you do not need a license file. For Professional
    and Enterprise editions, install your license file as described in your
    distribution.


4.  Building.

    This step compiles the Qt library, and builds the example programs,
    the tutorial, and the tools (e.g. Qt Designer, etc.).

    Type:

	./configure

    This will configure the Qt library for your machine. Note that
    GIF support is turned off by default. Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.

    To create the library and compile all the examples and the
    tutorial, type:

	make

    If your platform or compiler is not supported, please contact us at
    qt-bugs@trolltech.com so that we can assist you. If it is supported
    but you have problems, see http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/ for
    information on known issues.


5.  Installing.

    Once you have built Qt, it is ready to use. If
    you want to be able to double-click on your applications in the
    Finder, you must place the relevant libraries in a directory where
    they can be found. We recommend making these symbolic links:

    ln -s $QTDIR/lib/libqt.%VERSION_NUMBER%.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -s $QTDIR/lib/libqui.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -s $QTDIR/lib/libeditor.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib

    You may need to have 'administrator' access to do this, (in which
    case, precede each command with 'sudo', e.g. 'sudo ln -s ...'). If
    you use sudo you'll be prompted for the administrator password.


That's all! Qt is now installed. Qt's documentation can be read with
Qt Assistant or by any web browser; the contents page is:
    $QTDIR/doc/html/index.html
