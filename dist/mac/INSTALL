			  INSTALLING Qt/Mac Version %VERSION% (for Mac OS X)


1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /Developer
	gnutar xzvf Full_Path_to_Directory_You_Unpacked_To/%DISTNAME%.tar.gz

    This creates the directory /Developer/%DISTNAME% containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Rename %DISTNAME% to qt (or make a symlink):

	mv %DISTNAME% qt

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is unpacked in /Developer/qt.


2.  Set some environment variables in the file .login (or .profile or
    something else depending on your shell) in your home directory.
    Create this file if it is not already there. You can check your shell
    by typing:

    finger Your_Login

    The variables that you must set are:

	QTDIR		   - wherever you installed Qt
	PATH		   - to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	MANPATH 	   - to access the Qt man pages
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH  - for the shared Qt library

    This is done like this:

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

	setenv QTDIR /Developer/qt
	setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

        ***************************WARNING******************************
        * Some versions of tcsh do not understand the expansion of empty
        * variables. If you experience any error messages with the above
        * instructions, you may want to replace them with:
        *
	*  setenv QTDIR /Developer/qt
	*  setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	*  setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man
	*  setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib

    In .profile (if your shell is bash), add the following lines:

	QTDIR=/Developer/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QTDIR PATH MANPATH DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

    If you use a different shell, please modify your environment variables
    accordingly.

3.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license
    file as $HOME/.qt-license.

4.  Building.

    This step compiles the Qt library, and builds the example programs,
    the tutorial, and the tools (e.g. Qt Designer, etc.).

    Type:

        cd $QTDIR
	./configure

    This will configure the Qt library for your machine.  Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. 

    To create the library and compile all the examples and the
    tutorial, type:

	/usr/bin/make

    If your platform or compiler is not supported, please contact us at
    qt-bugs@trolltech.com so that we can assist you. If it is supported
    but you have problems, see http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/ for
    information on known issues.


5.  Launching Qt applications from the Finder.

    Once you have built Qt, it is ready to use. If Qt has not been 
    configured with the -static option, then in order to be able to 
    launch Qt applications from the Finder you must place the relevant
    libraries in a directory where they can be found. We recommend
    making these symbolic links (if you have configured Qt with -thread [ie
    threading enabled], please change the libqt below with libqt-mt):

    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqt.3.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqui.1.dylib /usr/lib

    You may need to have 'administrator' access to do this, (in which
    case, precede each command with 'sudo', e.g. 'sudo ln -s ...'). If
    you use sudo you'll be prompted for your password.

    If you do not have administrator access, or you would prefer to do
    a user install (rather than system install) of the libraries you 
    can do (if you have configured Qt with -thread [ie threading enabled],
    please change the libqt below with libqt-mt):

    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqt.3.dylib $HOME/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqui.1.dylib $HOME/lib


That's all! Qt is now installed. Qt's documentation can be read with
Qt Assistant or by any web browser; the contents page is:
    $QTDIR/doc/html/index.html

See the PLATFORM file for details pertaining to your environment.
