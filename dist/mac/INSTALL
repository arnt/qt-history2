                          INSTALLING Qt/Mac Version %VERSION%

1.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license
    file as $HOME/.qt-license.

    For the open source version you do not need a license file.

2.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

        cd /tmp
        gunzip %DISTNAME%.tar.gz        # uncompress the archive
        tar xvf %DISTNAME%.tar          # unpack it

    This creates the directory /tmp/%DISTNAME% containing the files
    from the archive.

3.  Building

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type:

        cd /tmp/%DISTNAME%
        ./configure

    Type "./configure -help" to get a list of all available options.
    Note that you will need to specify -universal if you want to
    build universal binaries, and also supply a path to the -sdk
    option if your development machine has a PowerPC CPU.

    To create the library and compile all the demos, examples, tools,
    and tutorials, type:

        make

    To install the library, demos, examples, tools, and tutorials,
    type:

        sudo make install

    and enter your password, this requires that you have administrator access
    to your machine. Qt is by default installed into
    /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION% but this can be changed by using the
    -prefix parameter.

    If you need to reconfigure and rebuild Qt from the same location,
    ensure that all traces of the previous configuration are removed
    by entering the build directory and typing

        make confclean

    before running the configure script again.

    NOTE: If you encounter problems with header files having a size of zero and 
    no permissions, remove these files and try building again. This is typically 
    encountered when building with multiple jobs, so try running make -j1 instead.
    This is a known issue, and should be fixed in an upcoming release.

4.  Environment variables

    In order to use Qt, some environment variables needs to be
    extended.

        PATH               - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash), add the following lines:

        PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH
        export PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following line:

        setenv PATH /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH

    If you use a different shell, please modify your environment
    variables accordingly.

5.  That's all. Qt is now installed.

    If you are new to Qt, we suggest that you take a look at the demos and
    examples to see Qt in action. Run the Qt Examples and Demos either by
    typing 'open /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin/qtdemo.app' on the
    command line or by double-clicking on the 'qtdemo' icon in the Finder.
