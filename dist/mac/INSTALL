			  INSTALLING Qt/Mac Version %VERSION%

1.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license
    file as $HOME/.qt-license.

    For the open source version you do not need a license file.

2.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /tmp
	gunzip %DISTNAME%.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xvf %DISTNAME%.tar		# unpack it

    This creates the directory /tmp/%DISTNAME% containing the files
    from the archive.

3.  Building

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type:

	cd /tmp/%DISTNAME%
	./configure

    Type "./configure -help" to get a list of all available options.

    To create the library and compile all the demos, examples, tools
    and tutorials type:

	make

    To install the library, demos, examples, tools
    and tutorials type:

	make install

    Qt is by default installed into /Developer/Qt but this can be
    changed by using the -prefix parameter.

4.  Environment variables

    In order to use Qt, some environment variables needs to be
    extended.

	PATH		   - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash), add the following line:

	PATH=/Developer/Qt/bin:$PATH
	export PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following line:

	setenv PATH /Developer/Qt/bin:$PATH

    If you use a different shell, please modify your environment variables
    accordingly.

That's all.  Qt is now installed.
