                          INSTALLING Qt/Mac Version %VERSION%

1.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license
    file as $HOME/.qt-license.

    For the open source version you do not need a license file.

2.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

        cd /tmp
        gunzip %DISTNAME%.tar.gz        # uncompress the archive
        tar xvf %DISTNAME%.tar          # unpack it

    This creates the directory /tmp/%DISTNAME% containing the files
    from the archive.

3.  Building

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type:

        cd /tmp/%DISTNAME%
        ./configure

    Type "./configure -help" to get a list of all available options.

    To create the library and compile all the demos, examples, tools,
    and tutorials, type:

        make

    To install the library, demos, examples, tools, and tutorials,
    type:

        sudo make install

    and enter your password, this requires that you have administrator access
    to your machine. Qt is by default installed into
    /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION% but this can be changed by using the
    -prefix parameter.

4.  Environment variables

    In order to use Qt, some environment variables needs to be
    extended.

        PATH               - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash), add the following lines:

        PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH
        export PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following line:

        setenv PATH /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH

    If you use a different shell, please modify your environment
    variables accordingly.

5.  That's all. Qt is now installed.

    If you are new to Qt, we suggest that you take a look at the demos and
    examples to see Qt in action. Run the Qt Examples and Demos either by
    typing 'open /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin/qtdemo.app' on the
    command line or by double-clicking on the 'qtdemo' icon in the Finder.
