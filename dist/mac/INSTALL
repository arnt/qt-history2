			  INSTALLING Qt/Mac Version %VERSION% (for Mac OS X)


1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /Developer
	tar xzvf Full_Path_to_Directory_You_Unpacked_To/%DISTNAME%.tar.gz

    This creates the directory /Developer/%DISTNAME% containing the
    files from the main archive.

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is unpacked in /Developer/qt.

2.  Set some environment variables in the file .login (or .profile or
    something else depending on your shell) in your home directory.
    Create this file if it is not already there. You can check your shell
    by typing:

    finger Your_Login

    The variables that you must set are:

	QTDIR		   - wherever you installed Qt
	PATH		   - to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH  - for the shared Qt library

    This is done like this:

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

	setenv QTDIR /Developer/qt
	setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

        ***************************WARNING******************************
        * Some versions of tcsh do not understand the expansion of empty
        * variables. If you experience any error messages with the above
        * instructions, you may want to replace them with:
        *
	*  setenv QTDIR /Developer/qt
	*  setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	*  setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib

    In .profile (if your shell is bash), add the following lines:

	QTDIR=/Developer/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QTDIR PATH DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

    If you use a different shell, please modify your environment variables
    accordingly.

3.  Make a symbolic link from $QTDIR/doc/man to $QTDIR/man by typing the following:

        ln -s $QTDIR/doc/man $QTDIR/man

    This will give you the man pages for the commandline Qt programs.

4.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license
    file as $HOME/.qt-license.

5.  Building.

    This step compiles the Qt libraries, the demo programs, and the
    tools (e.g. Qt Linguist, etc.).

    Type:

        cd $QTDIR
	./configure

    This will configure the Qt libraries for your machine.  Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. 

    To create compile everything, simply type:

	/usr/bin/make

    This technology preview was tested on Mac OS X 10.3 with Xcode Tools 1.2
    and higher.  If your platform or compiler is not supported, please contact
    us at qt-bugs@trolltech.com so that we can assist you. If it is supported
    but you have problems, see http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/ for
    information on known issues.

6.  Launching Qt applications from the Finder.

    If you built Qt using the -static option, your executables will contain the
    Qt library and can be run from Finder automatically. Otherwise, your
    executables will need to use the Qt library on your system. You can acheive
    this by using symbolic links. In the examples below, if you've built a
    debug version of the Qt libraries, add _debug to the end of the library
    name, (example libQtCore_debug.4.dylib instead of libQtCore.4.dylib.)

    We recommend making these symbolic links:

    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtCore.4.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtGui.4.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtNetwork.4.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtSql.4.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtOpenGL.4.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtXml.4.dylib /usr/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQt3Compat.4.dylib /usr/lib

    You may need to have 'administrator' access to do this, (in which
    case, precede each command with 'sudo', e.g. 'sudo ln -s ...'). If
    you use sudo you'll be prompted for your password.

    If you do not have administrator access, or you would prefer to do
    a user install (rather than system install) of the libraries you 
    can do:

    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtCore.4.dylib $HOME/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtGui.4.dylib $HOME/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtNetwork.4.dylib $HOME/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtSql.4.dylib $HOME/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtOpenGL.4.dylib $HOME/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQtXml.4.dylib $HOME/lib
    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libQt3Compat.4.dylib $HOME/lib

    Note: you can also achieve similar functionality by adding your
    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to the GUI's environment.

That's all! Qt is now installed. Qt's documentation can be read with
Qt Assistant or by any web browser; the contents page is:
    $QTDIR/doc/html/index.html

See the PLATFORM file for details pertaining to your environment.
