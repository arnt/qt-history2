Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  macx-g++ 
  macx-pbuilder

Compilation problems:

  Qt 3.x may have problems compiling on some combinations of operating
  system versions and compiler versions. Information about such
  problems will be posted on http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/ as we
  become aware of them.

Fink:

  If you have installed the Qt package from Fink, it will set the
  QMAKESPEC enviroment variable to darwin-g++. This will cause
  problems when you build the Qt/Mac package. To fix this, simply
  unset your QMAKESPEC or set it to macx-g++ before you run
  configure. You need to have a fresh Qt distribution (make confclean).

Example:

  ./configure -platform macx-g++ -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files to
  the mkspecs directory. The configuration macx-g++ is included
  as an example. It uses GNU g++ as a C/C++ compiler.
