Before you build the Qt libraries and demo programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  macx-g++ (Mac OS X 10.3, should also work on 10.2)

Compilation problems:

  If you have installed the Qt/X11 package from Fink (http://fink.sf.net), it
  will set the QMAKESPEC environment variable to darwin-g++. This will cause
  problems when you build the Qt/Mac package. To fix this, simply  unset your
  QMAKESPEC or set it to macx-g++ before you run configure. You need to have a
  fresh Qt distribution (make confclean).

  If you experience problems compiling Qt 4.x consult the platform
  notes found at http://www.trolltech.com/developer/platforms/ where
  we post workarounds and known issues as we become aware of them.

Example:

  ./configure -platform macx-g++ -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files to the
  mkspecs directory. Use a copy of the macx-g++ mkspec as an example. It uses
  GCC as a C/C++ compiler.
