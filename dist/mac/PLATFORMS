Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  macx-g++ macx-pbuilder

Compilation problems:

  Qt 3.x has problems compiling on some combinations of operating
  system versions and compiler versions.  Information about such
  problems will be posted on http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/ as we
  become aware of them.

Example:

  ./configure -platform macx-g++ -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files to
  the mkspecs directory. The configuration macx-g++ is included
  as an example. It uses GNU g++ as a C/C++ compiler.
