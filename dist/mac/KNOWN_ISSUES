This is a general Qt/Mac guide, this will outline known issues in Qt/Mac:

MacOSX:

Applications *must* be run out of a bundle (something like
widgets.app/). Mac OS X needs this to dispatch events correctly, as well as
gaining access to the menubar. If using GDB you must run with the *full*
path to the executable.

CodeWarrior and Project Builder are not support currently. CodeWarrior 7.0
has been evaluated however turned out to have trouble linking against a Qt
compiled with CW7. We are in contact with Metrowerks about the problem and
hopefully a solution will be found, in the meantime, our current
recommendation is to use project files with qmake (documentation located in
QTDIR/docs/qmake.html), this will only generate unix style makefiles for
now - however when CodeWarrior and/or Project Builder is supported we will
integrate the support with qmake and you can continue as you worked before
except having qmake generate project files for your IDE.
