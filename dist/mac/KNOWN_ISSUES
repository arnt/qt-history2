This is a general Qt/Mac guide, this will outline known issues in Qt/Mac:

MacOSX:

Applications *must* be run out of a bundle (something like widgets.app/). MacOSX needs this 
to dispatch events correctly, as well as gaining access to the menubar. If using GDB you must
run with the *full* path to the executable.

CodeWarrior and Project Builder are not support currently. CodeWarrior 7.0 is being evaluated 
and hopefully support will be added shortly, our current recommendation is to use project files
with qmake (documentation located in QTDIR/docs/qmake.html), this will only generate unix style 
makefiles for now - however when CodeWarrior and/or Project Builder is supported we will integrate
the support with qmake and you can continue as you worked before except having qmake generate
project files for your IDE.

QProcess does not seem to work very well on MacOSX, please don't use it at the moment until we
can verify the problems currently acknowledged in it.
