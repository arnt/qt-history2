This is a general Qt/Mac guide that outlines known issues for Qt/Mac.

Applications *must* be run out of a bundle (something like
widgets.app/). Mac OS X needs this to dispatch events correctly, as
well as gaining access to the menubar. If using GDB you must run with
the *full* path to the executable.
