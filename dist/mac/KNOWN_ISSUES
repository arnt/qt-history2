This is a general Qt/Mac guide that outlines known issues for Qt/Mac.

Mac OS X:

Applications *must* be run out of a bundle (something like
widgets.app/). Mac OS X needs this to dispatch events correctly, as
well as gaining access to the menubar. If using GDB you must run with
the *full* path to the executable.

CodeWarrior and Project Builder are not currently supported. We are
working on CodeWarrior support, but we have problems linking against a
Qt compiled with CW7. We are in contact with Metrowerks about this
issue and hope that a solution will be found.

For the time being our recommendation is to use project files with
qmake (documentation located in QTDIR/docs/qmake.html). This will only
generate unix style makefiles for now -- but when CodeWarrior and/or
Project Builder is supported we will integrate the support with qmake
so that you can continue to work as before, except that qmake will be
capable of generating project files for your IDE.
