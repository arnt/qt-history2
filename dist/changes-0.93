Here is a list of (major) changes in Qt from 0.92 to 0.93.

Bug-fixes and improved documentation, of course.


QObject:
--------
  timerEvent() moved from QWidget, does not affect old code.


QPainter:
---------
  drawShade* moved to qdrawutl.h
	- now global functions that take a QPainter * and QColorGroup
	- added drawWinPanel and drawWinButton for Windows 95 look
!!qDrawShade
  GC caching (internal optimization) makes drawing very fast.


New classes:
------------
  QSocketNotifier, makes it possible to write async socket code.
