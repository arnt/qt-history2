employment or whilst engaged in activities that will be

its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market the

libraries or code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") 
to implement various functions.  Third Party Libraries are 
not prepared by or owned by Trolltech, and do not comprise 
part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third 
Party Libraries may be included along with the Licensed 
Software delivery as a convenience for development and testing 
only. Such source code and libraries do not comprise the 
Licensed Software.  Licensee acknowledges (1) that some Third 
Party Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright 
and patents from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution
