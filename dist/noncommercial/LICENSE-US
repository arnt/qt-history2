employment or whilst engaged in activities that will be

suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market the

using the Licensed Software. Under no circumstances may any 
copies of Redistributables be distributed separately. 

12. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party 
libraries or code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") 
to implement various functions.  Third Party Libraries are 
not prepared by or owned by Trolltech, and do not comprise 
part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third 
Party Libraries may be included along with the Licensed 
Software delivery as a convenience for development and testing 
only. Such source code and libraries do not comprise the 
Licensed Software.  Licensee acknowledges (1) that some Third 
Party Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright 
and patents from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution 
of any of the Licensed Software referencing any portion of a 
Third Party Library may require appropriate licensing from
