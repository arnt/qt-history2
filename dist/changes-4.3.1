Qt 4.3.1 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.3.0.

The Qt version 4.3 series is binary compatible with the 4.2.x, 4.1.x and
4.0.x series. Applications compiled for Qt 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 will continue to
run with Qt 4.3.

General Improvements
--------------------

- Translations
    * Updated the German translation to provide complete coverage of Qt.

- QDBusView
    * Now has an icon for Mac OS X and Windows.

Third party components
----------------------

- FreeType
    * Security fix (CVE-2007-2754): Integer overflow in the TT_Load_Simple_Glyph
      function in freetype 2.3.4 and earlier allows remote authenticated users
      users to execute arbitrary code via crafted BDF fonts.

- SQLite
    * File descriptors are not inherited during spawn() anymore.
