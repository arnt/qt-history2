Qt 4.3.1 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.3.0.

The Qt version 4.3 series is binary compatible with the 4.2.x, 4.1.x and
4.0.x series. Applications compiled for Qt 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 will continue to
run with Qt 4.3.

General Improvements
--------------------

- QAbstractPrintDialog
    * [163000] Fixed bug on unix where PrintSelection option would not be
               enabled unless PrintPageRange was enabled.

- QGraphicsView
    * [160828] Fixed bug in QGraphicsScene/View::render() which could cause
               nothing to be rendered for QPicture target devices.

- QPainter
    * [158815] Fixed rendering artifacts for extended composition modes with
               semitransparent or antialiased drawing.
    * [163744] Fixed aliased ellipse drawing artifacts (horizontal lines)
               in raster engine.
    * [166623] Fixed bug where gradients with ObjectBoundingMode would be
               drawn at an incorrect offset.
    * [167497] Fixed color bleeding artifacts at edges when drawing
               images/pixmaps with SmoothPixmapTransform on X11.
    * [168621] Fixed bug which would cause projective transformations to be
               incorrectly applied for non-top-level widgets.
    * [168623] Fixed drawing of gradients with projective transformations.

- QPixmap
    * [167841] Fixed bug where filling a QPixmap with an alpha color would
               fail to detach the pixmap, causing copies of the pixmap to
               be changed as well.

- QRegion
    * [167445] Removed potential assert in QRegion::operator^ on unix.

- QTextEdit

               for text documents.
    * [167377] Fixed performance regression when appending a lot of text in
               NoWrap line break mode when there is a horizontal scrollbar.

               paragraphs inside table cells to be ignored.
    * [168406] Fixed rendering bug which would cause incorrect background
               fills for paragraphs with a left margin set.
