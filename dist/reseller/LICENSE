Software or in any modifications to the Licensed Software shall pass to
the Reseller under any circumstances. The Licensed Software is 
licensed, not sold. 

3. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software, 
Reseller agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Reseller
does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Reseller should not 
install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software.

the Licensed Software.  Reseller acknowledges (1) that some Third 
Party Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright and 
patents from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution of any 
of the Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party 
Library may require appropriate licensing from such third parties. 
Third Party Libraries include but are not limited to the following 
categories:  GIF, JPEG and MPEG.  

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, 
title and non-infringement with regard to the Licensed Software.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
9. If, Trolltech's warranty disclaimer notwithstanding, 
Trolltech is held liable to Reseller, whether in contract, tort 
or any other legal theory, based on the Licensed Software, Trolltech's 
entire liability to Reseller and Reseller's exclusive remedy shall be, 
at Trolltech's option, either (A) return of the price Reseller paid for
the Licensed Software, or (B) repair or replacement of the Licensed 
Software, provided Reseller returns to Trolltech all copies of the 
Licensed Software as originally delivered to Reseller. Trolltech shall 
not under any circumstances be liable to Reseller based on failure of 
the Licensed Software if the failure resulted from accident, abuse or 
misapplication, nor shall Trolltech under any circumstances be liable 
for special damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for loss of
profits or interruption of business or for loss or corruption of data. 
Any award of damages from Trolltech to Reseller shall not exceed the

Agreement.
