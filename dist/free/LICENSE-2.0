<!-- remove all lines starting with less-than to get plaintext version -->
<p>Included below is the license offered for the Qt Free Edition.  The license
<!-- -->is called the Q Public License (or "QPL"), and qualifies as
<!-- -->an <a href=http://www.opensource.org/osd.html>Open Source license</a>.
<!-- -->It is thus appropriate for people wishing to write
<!-- -->software under the <a href=http://www.opensource.org/>Open Source</a>
<!-- -->model where all source code to
<!-- -->the software is made available to all users and can be freely
<!-- -->modified and redistributed.
<p>The license has features that make it well suited to Qt:
<ul>
<li>Patches are distinct from the original, making it easier
<!-- -->to apply old patches to new Qt versions.
<li>Patches can be incorporated into new Qt versions.
<li>Binaries <em>can</em> have the same name as the original - important
<!-- -->for dynamic libraries.
<li>Anyone can make bug-fixes - important for distributors of systems.
<li>The Qt Free Edition can be used to
<!-- -->run software written with the Qt Professional Edition.
</font></i>
</ul>Free software development with the Qt Free Edition is additionally protected
<!-- -->by the <a href=http://www.troll.no/kde-freeqt/>KDE Free Qt Foundation</a>.
<p><b>To develop software with the Qt Free Edition,</b> simply meet
<!-- -->the requirements in the QPL.
<!-- -->Your software can be licensed by any license
<!-- -->that permits the requirements in section 5.
