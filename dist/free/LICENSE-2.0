<!-- remove all lines starting with less-than to get plaintext version -->
<p>Included below is the license offered for the Qt Free Edition.  The license
<!-- -->is called the Qt Public License (or "QPL"), and qualifies as
<!-- -->an <a href=http://www.opensource.org/osd.html>Open Source license</a>.
<!-- -->It is thus appropriate for people wishing to write
<!-- -->software under the <a href=http://www.opensource.org/>Open Source</a>
<!-- -->model where all source code to
<!-- -->the software is made available to all users and can be freely
<!-- -->modified and redistributed.
<p>The license has features that make it useful for Qt:
<ul>
<li>Patches are clearly distinct from the original, so you can keep
<!-- -->applying old patches to new versions of Qt.
<li>Patches are distributed under a very liberal license, so they can
<!-- -->be used by Troll Tech in new Qt versions.
<li>Binaries <em>can</em> have the same name as the original, so
<!-- -->distributors can make bug-fixes etc. without having to
<!-- -->change all packages which link to the binary.
<li>The Qt Free Edition can be used to
<!-- -->run commercial software written with the Qt Profession Edition
<!-- -->without having to install another library.
</font></i>
</ul>
<p>To use the Qt Free Edition under the QPL, simply meet the
<!-- -->requirements therein.  Your software can be licensed by any license
<!-- -->that meets the requirements.
<!-- -->
<p>To use this license
<!-- -->for you own software, add a notice to the software saying
<!-- -->your software may be distributed under the terms of the Qt
<!-- -->Public License version 1.0.
