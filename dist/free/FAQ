    1.Who is Troll Tech? 

       Troll Tech is a company based in Oslo, the capital of Norway. Our
       business idea is to develop and market our multi-platform, superior
       quality, GUI toolkit: Qt. 

       Troll Tech AS was founded in 1994. However, the core team of
       designers at Troll Tech started developing Qt already in 1992. Ever
       since then, Qt has steadily expanded and improved. Qt is currently
       used in hundreds of software development projects world wide. 

       In addition to Qt development and support, Troll Tech engages on a
       consultancy basis in a large-scale software development project.
       The project, which naturally is based on Qt, is run by the Norwegian
       division of NCR (previously AT&T). 

    2.Do you have any plans for a graphical designer/dialog builder? 

       We are working on one now. There will be further announcements
       on qt-interest and, as appropriate, qt-announce. 

       There is also a free dialog editor written by Jeff Harris and Klaus
       Ebner. See http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~jharris/dlgedit/ for more
       information. 

    3.Is there a mailing list or something for Qt? 

       There are two: qt-interest@troll.no and qt-announce. 

       Qt-interest is a user forum. There can be as much as 20 messages
       per week. To join it, send a message containing the single word
       "subscribe" to qt-interest-request@troll.no. 

       Qt-announce is for announcements of new Qt versions and a few
       other announcements. We expect that there will be less than ten
       messages to the list each year. To join the list, send mail containing
       the single word "subscribe" to qt-announce-request@troll.no. 

       All messages to Qt-announce are also sent to Qt-interest, so you
       don't need to be on both lists. 

    4.Can I use Qt's classes without writing a graphical user interface? 

       Quite a few of the classes can be used independently of the user
       interface. See utility classes, for example. There are also a few
       classes that will work without the GUI only by chance. 

    5.What kind of licenses exist for Qt? 

       The Qt toolkit is available under two different licenses: The
       professional license for commercial use, and the free license for
       developing free software for the X platform. 

    6.What are the differences between the professional and free licenses
       of Qt? 

       You can write commercial software only if you have professional
       license(s). The library itself is the same. You also get one year of
       free support and upgrades when you buy professional license(s). 

    7.Are you going to include so-and-so feature in Qt? If so, when? 

       We try not to make public speculations about the whats and whens
       of the next Qt release too early, because we do not want to be
       known as a vaporware company.

    8.Why did you suddenly release version 1.30?  Wasn't the previous
      release 1.2?

       Some platforms do not support three-level version numbering,
       therefore the bugfix release following version 1.2 was called
       1.21. Version 1.30 is the first major release after 1.2, and
       1.40 the next major release.

    9.I don't want to give away my source code. What do I do? 

       Then you need professional license(s). 

   10.Can I charge for my application? 

       If you have a professional license: Yes, of course. If you use the
       free license your software must be freely distributable and you must
       include the source. 

       The free license is intended for free software. We realize that
       CD-ROMs cost money to produce, for example, so you can charge
       a copying fee. 

   11.Where can I find Qt? 

       The latest version of Qt can be downloaded from http://www.troll.no
       or from ftp.troll.no, and a whole range of ftp mirror sites around the
       world. Look for a mirror near you on the list available under
       http://www.troll.no/dl/ 

       We encourage all developers of free Qt software to upload their
       work to ftp.troll.no. 

   12.I want to port Qt to a new platform. What do I do? 

       If the new platform is POSIX-like and runs the X Window System,
       it's simple. Read the file PORTING for details. If you succeed you
       can contact us at info@troll.no. 

   13.Will Qt be available for [OS/2, Mac, Amiga]? 

       At present, Qt only works well on X11 and Win32 (Windows 95 and
       Windows NT). Porting to other platforms is a lower priority.
       Currently, we concentrate on the Windows and X versions. 

   14.Can I make a Qt shared library and distribute it with my Linux
       distribution? 

       Yes, if you do not make changes to Qt and include all the files
       present in our distribution of Qt. (That is, you must include the
       source code.) 

   15.Can I distribute dynamically linked applications that use Qt? Can I
       distribute statically linked applications that use Qt? 

       Yes and yes. If you are using the free software license, you may not
       modify Qt in either case. 

   16.I found this obscure bug and I need it fixed, fast! 

       We sell support and maintenance contracts. We try to support the
       developers using the free software license as well, and we take all
       bug reports seriously, no matter who they come from. But, of
       course, when there's too much to do, our customers have higher
       priority. 

   17.The Qt demos I've seen only have one window. Can I have several
       windows in one application? 

       Yes, easily.
