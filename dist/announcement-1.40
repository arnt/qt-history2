		 TROLL TECH RELEASES QT VERSION 1.40

Troll Tech (http://www.troll.no) is proud to announce that we have now
released version 1.40 of Qt, the multi-platform C++ Graphical User
Interface toolkit.

The Qt library provides application developers with the full
functionality required for making state-of-the-art GUI applications for
Unix/X11 and Microsoft Windows, replacing the need to use Motif/Xt
or Microsoft Foundation Classes libraries.

The 1.40 version of Qt introduces more than 11 new GUI elements
(widgets) which increase the ease of creating modern style GUIs, for
example a hierarchical list view and multi-columned lists, in the
style of e.g. Windows Explorer, and tool bars with tool buttons. 

Qt 1.40 also introduces native Drag-and-Drop support.

With Qt 1.40 is included the new Qt Xt/Motif Extension, which aids the
migration of Motif or Xt-based legacy code by allowing such code to
coexist and communicate with Qt-based code in the same application.

In addition, Qt 1.40 adds a wide range of smaller improvements and
functionality enhancements. For details, please see

This new release of Qt retains source compatibility as well as dynamic
library binary compatibility with the previous Qt 1.x versions.

Qt is released in two different versions:

- The Qt Free Edition, which may be used free of charge for developing
  Free (non-proprietary) Software on Unix/X11. This version is
  available for download from http://www.troll.no/dl/

- The Qt Professional Edition, which may be used to develop
  commercial/proprietary software on Unix/X11 and Microsoft
  Windows. For pricing and availability, please see
