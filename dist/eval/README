Getting Started with Qt/Windows Evaluation version
==================================================

Thank you for choosing to evaluate Qt/Windows!

This Qt/Windows Evaluation version has the following limitations compared
to the full Qt/Windows Professional and Enterprise Editions:

* The Qt source code is not included. Instead, the Qt library is
  provided pre-compiled.

* The library is time-limited to work for 30 days.

* The library is pre-built as a dynamic, multi-threaded library
  without debugging information. In the full versions, you may choose
  to build it as a static or dynamic library with multi-threaded mode
  turned on or off. You may also build it with or without debugging
  information included to help with application development.

* Applications display an information window on startup

* GIF support is disabled


MS Visual Studio
----------------

If you use MS Visual Studio 6 for development, you may want to install
the Qt add-in that we provide. This can be done as follows:

1. Start Visual Studio if it isn't already running.
2. Click Tools|Customize to launch the Customize dialog. 
3. Click the Add-ins and Macro Files tab.
4. Ensure the checkbox to the left of the "QMsDev Developer Studio-Add-In"
   add-in is checked.
5. Click Close. 

If you use MS Visual Studio .NET 2002 and later, the add-in is installed
automatically at the end of the Qt installation.

The add-in is now installed. A new floating toolbar will appear with the
following toolbar buttons:

- New Qt Project - create a Qt .pro project file and the corresponding
  Visual Studio .dsp file.
- Generate Qt Project - create a Visual Studio .dsp file based on a Qt
  project .pro file.
- New Qt Dialog - creates a Qt dialog that you can customize with Qt
  Designer. The dialog is automatically added to the Qt .pro project file.
- Qt Designer - launches Qt Designer.
- Add MOC - add a custom build step which calls moc.exe (meta object
  compiler)
- Add UIC - add an existing Qt Designer .ui file to an existing project. 

More information about the add-in is available in the chapter "Customizing
and Integrating Qt Designer" in the Qt Designer manual which is included
in the online reference manual. For the MS Visual Studio .NET integration
see also the file Usage.rtf that is located in the installation directory
for the integration (C:\Program Files\Trolltech\QMsNet).

MS Visual Studio project (.dsp and .vcproj) files are provided for all Qt
example and tutorial programs.


The Qt Reference Manual
-----------------------

The full Qt reference documentation in HTML format is included with this
evaluation edition. You can read it using the Qt Assistant tool, which is
available from the Qt submenu on the Start menu. You can also read it by
opening the file %QTDIR%\doc\html\index.html with any web browser.

If you are new to Qt programming, we recommend that you check out the
tutorial section and the Qt Designer manual. We also suggest that you
obtain a copy of one of the many books about Qt programming that are
available. For further information, see:

http://www.trolltech.com/developer/documentation/literature.html


Building Qt programs
--------------------

Qt programs may be built either from MS Visual Studio or from the command
line (i.e. in a Command Prompt window). When working from the command
line, the qmake tool is invaluable. It builds Makefiles for your project
and compiler from a simple project description (.pro) file. The .pro file
is generated by Qt Designer when you save a project. It can also be
manually created with a text editor. See the qmake section in the Qt
reference documentation for further information.


Database Drivers
----------------

The installation program allows you to choose database drivers.

The client libraries for MySQL and PostgreSQL are included in the package.
NOTE: For the evaluation version compiled with Borland, no PostgreSQL
database driver is included due to the fact that the PostgreSQL client
library header files are incompatible with the Borland compiler.


The ODBC client library should be available on every Windows installation.

The Oracle (OCI) driver requires that the Oracle client is properly
installed and configured. The DB2 driver requires the same for the DB2
client.

The TDS driver is built with the DB-Library supplied by Microsoft. In the
full version of Qt/Windows, it is also possible to build it against the
Sybase Open Client.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If Qt Assistant shows up blank, or compilation of a Qt program fails
because e.g. the moc.exe or Qt header files cannot be found, check if the
PATH contains the %QTDIR%\bin directory and the environment variable QTDIR
has been set. After installing Qt, you may need to reboot your computer to
make sure these settings are in effect.

If the compilation on the command line fails because the "make", "nmake",
or the compiler itself cannot be found, you must ensure that the
environment (PATH etc.) is set up for command-line use of the
compiler. For Microsoft Visual C++ users, run the vcvars32.bat file to
set up the environment. This file can be found in the bin directory of
the Visual Studio installation.

If the compilation fails because the compiler does not find the system
header files (e.g. stdio.h or windows.h), you must set the INCLUDE and LIB
environment variables to contain the paths of the compiler's header files
and library files. For Microsoft Visual C++ users, the vcvars32.bat file
takes care of this.


Reporting Bugs, Mailing List and Support
----------------------------------------

If you should find something you believe to be a bug in Qt, please send a
report to qt-bugs@trolltech.com. Include as much information as you can
about your environment and versions.

If you want to join the Qt users' mailing list, send a mail to
qt-interest-request@trolltech.com containing the single word "subscribe".

The Trolltech technical support service is available to Qt Professional
and Enterprise Edition licensees. As an evaluation user, you can register
for 30 days of evaluation support at
