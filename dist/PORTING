                        PORTING QT TO OTHER PLATFORMS

If you want to port Qt a new platform or C++, this file instructs you how
to proceed.

                               REQUIREMENTS

The new platform needs Xlib for X11R5 or newer. Motif is not required. If
it is not a Unix system (for instance VMS) things may get complicated.
Porting to other Unixes is pretty straight-forward.

Qt requires that your C++ compiler supports multiple inheritance. Template
support is recommended but not a necessity. It must recognize the .cpp
extension. Exception handling and RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) are
not required. Expect problems with old CFront-based compilers.

We would like the patches so we can support this new platforms in future
releases of Qt.
