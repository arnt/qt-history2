Change the version number in qglobal.h
Change the version number in various files under qt/dist:	
	perl -p -i.bak -e 's/1\.30/1.31/g' commercial/* free/* win/* x11/*
  Diff and double check afterwards

Also change the version number in:
	qt/html/license.html
	qt/src/qtx11.pro
	qt/doc/misc.doc

    (alternative: Make a system that changes the version number
     automatically, so we won't have to do this next time)


Check that GIFs made by util/makegifs/Makefile are up-to-date, and do not
 include any unreleased widgets!
    (alternative: make mkdist do this - probably too slow)

Check that qdoc reports 0 undocumented member functions
    (alternative: make mkdist fail)
