FOR PROFESSIONAL AND ENTERPRISE EDITIONS
Agreement version 1.1


IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: 
1. This Trolltech End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal 
agreement between you [either an individual or and educational and/or 
research institution ("Entity")]("Licensee") and Trolltech AS 
("Trolltech") for the Trolltech software product(s) accompanying this 
Agreement, which include(s) computer software and may include "online" 
or electronic documentation, associated media, and printed materials, 
including the source code, example programs and the documentation 
("Licensed Software").

2. The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and 
international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual 
property laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not 
sold.

3. Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into 
Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of 
which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified 
in the license certificate ("License Certificate") accompanying the 
Licensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered 
part of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict 
between the language of this Agreement and the License Certificate, the 
provisions of this Agreement shall govern.
 
4. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software, 
Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee 
does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may not 
install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software; Licensee may, 
however, return it to Licensee's place of purchase for a full refund. 
In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise using any updates or 
other components of the Licensed Software that Licensee receives 
separately as part of the Licensed Software ("Updates"), Licensee 
agrees to be bound by any additional license terms that accompany such 
Updates. If Licensee does not agree to the additional license terms 
that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not install, copy, or 
otherwise use such Updates.

5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed  
Software in the manner provided below.

6. Trolltech grants to Licensee as an individual a personal, nonexclusive, 
nontransferable license to make and use copies of the 
Licensed Software for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and 
testing Licensee's software product(s) ("Applications") for development 
for educational, non-commercial research and/or administrative 
purposes. Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an 
unlimited number of computers provided that Licensee is the only 
individual using the Licensed Software. If Licensee is an Entity, 
Trolltech grants Licensee the right to designate one, and only one, 
individual within Licensee's organization who shall have the sole right 
to use the Licensed Software in the manner provided above. Licensee may 
at any time, but not more frequently that once every six (6) months, 
designate another individual to replace the current designated user by 
notifying Trolltech, so long as there is no more than one designated 
user at any given time.


7. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or 
code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to implement various 
functions.  Third Party Libraries are not prepared by or owned by 
Trolltech, and do not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some 
cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be included along with the 
Licensed Software delivery as a convenience for development and testing 
only. Such source code and libraries as are or may be listed in the 
".../src/3rdparty" source tree delivered with the Licensed Software, as 
may be amended from time to time, do not comprise the Licensed 
Software. Licensee acknowledges (1) that some Third Party Libraries  
may require additional licensing of copyright and patents from the 
owners of such, and (2) that distribution of any of the Licensed 
Software referencing any portion of a Third Party Library may require 
appropriate licensing from such third parties. Third Party Libraries 
include but are not limited to the following categories:  GIF, JPEG and 
MPEG.

Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the 
sole purpose of executing Applications permitted under this Agreement 
that Licensee has created using the Licensed Software.  Under no 
circumstances may any copies of Redistributables be distributed

(v) Applications must be developed using a licensed, registered copy of 
the Licensed Software; (vi) Applications must add primary and 
substantial functionality to the Licensed Software; (vii) Applications

held liable to Licensee, whether in contract, tort or any other legal 
theory, based on the Licensed Software, Trolltech's entire liability to 
Licensee and Licensee's exclusive remedy shall be, at Trolltech's 
option, either (A) return of the price Licensee paid for the Licensed 
Software, or (B) repair or replacement of the Licensed Software, 
provided Licensee returns to Trolltech all copies of the Licensed 
Software as originally delivered to Licensee. Trolltech shall not under 
any circumstances be liable to Licensee based on failure of the 
Licensed Software if the failure resulted from accident, abuse or 
misapplication, nor shall Trolltech under any circumstances be liable 
for special damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for loss of 
profits or interruption of business or for loss or corruption of data. 
Any award of damages from Trolltech to Licensee shall not exceed the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
12. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by authorized 
representatives of Licensee and Trolltech. In case of a conflict 
between the Agreement and the terms of any purchase order or other 
ordering document, the Agreement shall prevail. If any provision of the 
Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the remainder will remain 
valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any remedy provided is 
determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of 
liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this Agreement shall 
remain in effect.

13. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the 
laws of Norway, the legal venue to be Oslo City Court. Trolltech
