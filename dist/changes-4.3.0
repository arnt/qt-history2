 - QPrinter
        Added QPrinter::supportedPaperSources()

 - QChar
        Updated the Unicode tables to Unicode 5.0

 - QHeaderView
        Now uses Qt::NoFocus for its default focus policy

 - QTextDocumentFragment
        QTextDocumentFragment no more stores the root frame properties,
        the document title or the document default font when it's created
        from a document or from HTML. Use QTextDocument's toHtml/setHtml
        if you want to propagate these properties to and from HTML.
