****************************************************************************

 - QPrinter
        Added QPrinter::supportedPaperSources()

 - QChar
        Updated the Unicode tables to Unicode 5.0

 - QHeaderView
        Now uses Qt::NoFocus for its default focus policy

 - QTextDocumentFragment
        QTextDocumentFragment no more stores the root frame properties,
        the document title or the document default font when it's created
        from a document or from HTML. Use QTextDocument's toHtml/setHtml
        if you want to propagate these properties to and from HTML.


 - QTabBar 
        Added int tabAt(const QPoint &pos) const

 - QString
        fromUtf8() now discards UTF-8 encoded byte order marks just like the UTF-8 QTextCodec

 - QTextCursor
        The definition of the block char format (QTextCursor::blockCharFormat/QTextBlock::charFormat)
        has been changed to be the format used only when inserting text into an empty block.
        If a QTextCursor is positioned at the beginning of a block and the text block is not empty
        then the char format to the right of the cursor (the first character in the block) is returned.
        If the block is empty the block character format is returned.
        List markers are now also drawn with the character format of the first character in a block
        instead of the invisible block character format.

 - QDateTimeEdit
        Improvements with regards to two-digit years in a QDateTimeEdit. Make stepping work properly

 - QMainWindow 
        Fix a crash with QMainWindow:setMainWindow(0); on X11

 - QSpinBox
        Disallow typing -0 in a QSpinBox with a positive range
