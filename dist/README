This is Qt version 3.0.1, the cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit.

Qt 3 contains many new features, improvements and extensions. It also
includes a significantly improved Qt Designer, and introduces Qt
Linguist, Qt Assistant and a new multi-platform build tool,
'qmake'. In addition to the traditional Qt platforms Linux, Unix and
the various flavours of MS-Windows, Qt 3 for the first time also
introduces a native port to MacOS X.

Detailed information about the modifications and new features for Qt 3
is included in the Online Reference Documentation.

Because of our recently increased development team, we have been able
to realize far more of your requests in this release. Qt 3 is a great
step towards realizing our vision of an ideal cross-platform
development tool.

The Qt version 3.x series is not binary compatible with the 2.x
series. This means programs compiled with Qt version 2.x must be
recompiled to work with Qt 3.

Qt 3 is mostly, but not completely, source compatible with the Qt 2.x
series. See the document "Porting from Qt 2.x to Qt 3.0" in the Online
Reference Documentation for information on how to port an existing Qt
2.x-based program to Qt 3. Disclaimer: the guide is not entirely
complete, so it is possible that you'll discover issues that are not
yet covered in the documentation.

The most visible change for long term Qt users is the reworked build
system. On MS-Windows, unpack the package and start installer.exe; on
Unix, unpack the package and run ./configure. Compiling and installing
Qt uses a new utility 'qmake' which we recommend for writing Qt­based
applications. 'qmake' is the successor of our free software add-on
'tmake', and is written using Qt rather than Perl. 'qmake' is fully
compatible with 'tmake'.

To improve maintainaibility between different platforms, all specific
platform #defines and #includes have been moved out of the Qt sources
into a platform specific qplatformdefs.h file.  The files are located
in qt/mkspec/<platform>-<compiler>/qplatformdefs.h. For this release,
the following platforms have been tested:

win32-borland
win32-msvc

irix-o32
irix-n32
irix-g++
tru64-cxx
tru64-g++
solaris-cc
solaris-g++
linux-g++
