Trolltech has set up a special mailing list, qt4-preview-feedback, for
discussion of issues relating to the Qt 4 beta releases. To subscribe,
send a message containing just the word subscribe to
qt4-preview-feedback-request@trolltech.com.  We encourage you to use
this mailing list instead of qt-interest for Qt 4 specific issues. See
http://lists.trolltech.com/ for more information on Trolltech's
mailing lists, including archived discussions.

If you think you have found an actual bug in Qt, we would like to hear
about it so that we can fix it. In that case, please send the bug
report to qt-bugs@trolltech.com. Be aware that we cannot guarantee a
personal reply for all bug reports.

Before reporting a bug, please check the Known Issues page,
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.0/known-issues.html, on our web site to see
if the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report:

  The name and version number of your compiler
  The name and version number of your operating system
  The version of Qt you are using, and what configure options it was
  compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run. Often,
such a program can be created with some minor changes to one of the
many example programs in Qt's examples directory.

If you are a licensed customer, be aware that we cannot provide
technical support for beta releases. Use the qt4-preview-feedback
mailing list for questions related to the Qt 4 beta.
