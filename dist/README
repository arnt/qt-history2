This is Qt version %VERSION%.

Qt is a comprehensive cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt 4.0
introduces new features and many improvements over the 3.x series. See

packages, simply launch the package and follow the instructions in the
installation wizard.

If you have a source package (a .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .zip file),
