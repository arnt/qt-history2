Qt 4.2.3 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.2.0.

The Qt version 4.2 series is binary compatible with the 4.1.x and 4.0.x
series. Applications compiled for 4.0 or 4.1 will continue to run with 4.2.

    * Fixed crash in QSortFilterProxyModel when removing items from the source model.

      be added when inserting new items to the source model.

    * Fixed a crash in QTreeView that could appear when removing all the child from

      slot connected to one of QProcess' signals.

      return a short byte count.

- QTextDocument
    * Fixed find() with backward searches
    * Match CSS style selector case insensitively

- QSyntaxHighlighter
    * Fixed failing assertion when installing a syntax highlighter before the document
      has created a layout

- QPluginLoader
    * Fixed compilation of Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN when used with templates

- QTcpSocket
    * Fixed a bug where QTcpSocket would time out when connecting to a closed
      service on Windows.
    * Fixed a race condition when calling waitFor...() functions with a very
      short timeout value.
    * Fixed unexpected remote disconnect problems on Windows.
    * Improved the reliability of the waitFor...() functions with SOCKS5 proxy
      support.

- QTextLayout
    * Fixed rendering of surrogate pairs and cursor navigation with them

X11
---
    * Fixed detection of Type1 symbol fonts
    * Fixed crash on exit in QSystemTrayIcon when QApplication is used
      as the parent
    * Fixed animation GUI effects on tooltips, menus, and comboboxes
    * Fixed crashes in threaded programs when Qt uses the Glib main
      loop
    * Fixed empty LANG environment variable from preventing input of
      non-ascii chars in Qt widgets
    * Fixed leak of initial style created by QApplication after
      calling QApplication::setStyle()
    * Fixed erroneous event delivery to a widget that has been
      destroyed
    * Prevent shortcuts for arrow keys of keypad from being activated
      when numlock is on

Windows
-------
    * Fixed compilation with -no-stl
    * Fixed compilation with Windows SDK for Vista
    * Fixed an issue that could cause missing text when Cleartype was used.
    * Fixed the hot-spot location for OpenHandCursor and
      CloseHandCursor
    * Fixed infinite warning loop about adopted threads in
      applications with many threads
    * Fixed ASSERT caused by hiding child widget whose widnow has not
      yet been created
    * Fix QWindowsXPStyle so that it is possible to draw a QStyle::CE_DockWidgetTitle 
      without having an actual instance of QDockWidget.


Mac OS X
--------
    * Fix regression where dragging/copying unicode text in Qt to another
      application would only export the non-unicode version.
    * Fix regression where releasing the mouse button would send to mouse releases to the widget.
    * Fix regression where we would reset the drop action when we receided
      a native "DragLeave" event.
    * Wrapping a (non-Qt) window's content view and resizing before showing the window for the
      first time now works correctly.
    * Ensure that the content view is always created before we add any QWidgets
      to a window (this allows better integration with Cocoa apps).
    * Fix regression where we inadvertently disabled text/uri-list for clipboards.
    * Fix regression where setting the brushed metal style on a message box would show the
      label in "non-metal" look.
    * Fix the open source binary package to have the correct defines for development.
	* Fixed regression that widgets did not adhere to WindowStaysOnTopHint.
	
Qtopia Core
-----------

    * Fixed a data corruption bug in QDataStream on ARM processors when
      reading and writing doubles on devices where doubles have swapped word
      order, and qreals where qreal isn't a double. Corrupt data streams
      cannot be read.
