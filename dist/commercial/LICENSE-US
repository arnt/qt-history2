Qt COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
FOR PROFESSIONAL AND ENTERPRISE EDITIONS
Agreement version 2.6


IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: 
1. This Trolltech End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal
agreement between you (either an individual or a legal entity)
("Licensee") and Trolltech AS ("Trolltech") for the Trolltech software
product(s) accompanying this Agreement, which include(s) computer
software and may include "online" or electronicdocumentation,
associated media, and printed materials, including the source code,
example programs and the documentation ("Licensed Software").

2. The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and
international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not
sold.

3. Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into
Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of
which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified
in the license certificate ("License Certificate") accompanying the
Licensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered
part of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict
between the language of this Agreement and the License Certificate,
the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.
 
4. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software,
Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If
Licensee does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may
not install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software; Licensee
may, however, return it to Licensee's place of purchase within 14 days
for a full refund. In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise
using any updates or other components of the Licensed Software that
Licensee receives separately as part of the Licensed Software
("Updates"), Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional license
terms that accompany such Updates. If Licensee does not agree to the
additional license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not
install, copy, or otherwise use such Updates.

5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed
Software in the manner provided below.

6. Trolltech grants to Licensee as an individual a personal,
nonexclusive, non-transferable license to make and use copies of the
Licensed Software for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and
testing Licensee's software product(s) ("Applications"). Licensee may
install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited number of
computers provided that Licensee is the only individual using the
Licensed Software. If Licensee is an entity, Trolltech grants Licensee
the right to designate one, and only one, individual within Licensee's
organization who shall have the sole right to use the Licensed
Software in the manner provided above. Licensee may at any time, but
not more frequently that once every six (6) months, designate another
individual to replace the current designated user by notifying
Trolltech, so long as there is no more than one designated user at any
given time.

7. Verification: Trolltech may, upon its reasonable request and at its
expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Licensed
Software.  Any such audit shall be conducted during regular business
hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere
with Licensee's business activities.  If an audit reveals that
Licensee is using the Licensed Software in a way that is in material
violation of the terms of the Agreement, then Licensee shall pay
Trolltech's reasonable costs of conducting the audit.  In the case of
a material violation, Licensee agrees to pay Trolltech any amounts
owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use.  In the
alternative, Trolltech reserves the right, at Trolltech's sole option,
to terminate the licenses for the Licensed Software.


8. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or
code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to implement various
functions.  Third Party Libraries are not prepared by or owned by
Trolltech, and do not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some
cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be included along with the
Licensed Software delivery as a convenience for development and
testing only. Such source code and libraries as are or may be listed
in the ".../src/3rdparty" source tree delivered with the Licensed
Software, as may be amended from time to time, do not comprise the
Licensed Software.  Licensee acknowledges (1) that some Third Party
Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright and patents
from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution of any of the
Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party Library may
require appropriate licensing from such third parties. Third Party
Libraries include but are not limited to the following categories:
GIF, JPEG and MPEG.

GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES
9. Trolltech grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to
reproduce and distribute the object code form of certain portions of
the Licensed Software ("Redistributables"), as specified in Appendix
1, for execution on any operating system of a type listed in the
License Certificate ("Platforms"). Copies of Redistributables may only
be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing Applications
permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has created using the
Licensed Software.  Under no circumstances may any copies of
Redistributables be distributed separately.

10. The license granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create
Applications and distribute them and the Redistributables (if any) to
Licensee's customers is subject to all of the following conditions:
(i) all copies of the Applications Licensee creates must bear a valid
copyright notice, either Licensee's own or the copyright notice that
appears on the Licensed Software; (ii) Licensee may not remove or
alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice
contained in any portion of the Licensed Software; (iii)
Redistributables, if any, shall be licensed to Licensee's customer "as
is"; (iv) Licensee will indemnify and hold Trolltech, its related
companies and its suppliers, harmless from and against any claims or
liabilities arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of
Applications; (v) Applications must be developed using a licensed,
registered copy of the Licensed Software; (vi) Applications must add
primary and 'substantial functionality to the Licensed Software; (vii)
Applications may not pass on functionality which in any way makes it
possible for others to create software with the Licensed Software;
(viii) Applications may not compete with the Licensed Software; (ix)
Licensee may not use Trolltech's or any of its suppliers' names,
logos, or trademarks to market Application(s), except to state that
Application was developed using the Licensed Software.

NOTE: Qt Free Edition is licensed under the terms of the GPL and not
under this Agreement.  If Licensee has, at any time, developed all (or
any portions of) the Application(s) using Trolltech's publicly
licensed Qt Free Edition, Licensee must comply with Trolltech's
requirements (see
http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qt-x11.html) and license
such Application(s) (or any portions derived there from) under the
terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License
version 2 (the "GPL") a copy of which is located at
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1 (i.e., any Product(s) and/or
parts, components, portions thereof developed using GPL licensed
software, including Qt Free Edition, must be licensed under the terms
of the GPL, and the GPL-based source code must be made available upon
request).

ITSELF AND ITS SUPPLIERS, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
12. IF, TROLLTECH'S WARRANTY DISCLAIMER NOTWITHSTANDING, TROLLTECH IS
HELD LIABLE TO LICENSEE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
THEORY, BASED ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, TROLLTECH'S ENTIRE LIABILITY
TO LICENSEE AND LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE, AT TROLLTECH'S
OPTION, EITHER (A) RETURN OF THE PRICE LICENSEE PAID FOR THE LICENSED
SOFTWARE, OR (B) REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE,
PROVIDED LICENSEE RETURNS TO TROLLTECH ALL COPIES OF THE LICENSED
SOFTWARE AS ORIGINALLY DELIVERED TO LICENSEE. TROLLTECH SHALL NOT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE BASED ON FAILURE OF THE
LICENSED SOFTWARE IF THE FAILURE RESULTED FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE OR
MISAPPLICATION, NOR SHALL TROLLTECH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE
FOR SPECIAL DAMAGES, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, DAMAGES FOR LOSS
OF PROFITS OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR FOR LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF
DATA. ANY AWARD OF DAMAGES FROM TROLLTECH TO LICENSEE SHALL NOT EXCEED

THIS AGREEMENT.

SUPPORT AND UPDATES
13. Licensee will be eligible to receive email based software
developer support and access to Updates ("Support and Updates") to the

may be changed from time to time.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

14. Licensee Name: Trolltech may include Licensee's company name in a
publicly available list of Trolltech customers.

15: Renewal of Support and Updates: Licensee may purchase additional
Support and Updates following the Initial Term at Trolltech's terms
and conditions applicable at the time of renewal.

16. Termination: Trolltech may terminate the Agreement at any time
immediately upon written notice by Trolltech to Licensee if Licensee
breaches this Agreement, fails to pay the fees for the Licensed
Software, or infringes Trolltech's intellectual property in or to the
Licensed Software.  Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall
return to Trolltech all copies of Licensed Software that were supplied
by Trolltech.  All other copies of Licensed Software in the possession
or control of Licensee must be erased or destroyed.  An officer of
Licensee must promptly deliver to Trolltech a written confirmation
that this has occurred.

17. Government End Users: A "U.S. Government End User" shall mean any
agency or entity of the government of the United States.  The
following shall apply if Licensee is a U.S. Government End User.  The
Licensed Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
all U.S. Government End Users acquire the Licensed Software with only
those rights set forth herein.  The Licensed Software (including
related documentation) is provided to U.S. Government End Users: (a)
only as a commercial end item; and (b) only pursuant to this
Agreement.

COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS 
18. Licensee shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the Licensed Software in the United States and in other
countries in which Licensee uses or modifies the Licensed Software.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not
export, reexport, disclose or distribute any of the Licensed Software
in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including the
export laws and regulations of the United States, and shall comply
with all such laws and regulations.

19. Modification: This Agreement may only be modified in writing
signed by authorized representatives of Licensee and Trolltech. In
case of a conflict between the Agreement and the terms of any purchase
order or other ordering document, the Agreement shall prevail. If any
provision of the Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the
remainder will remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. If
any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential
purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set
forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect.

20. Governing law, legal venue: This Agreement shall be construed,
interpreted and governed by the laws of the State of California,
USA. Any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this
Agreement shall be brought in a federal court in the Northern District
of California or in the State Court in Santa Clara County, California,
and each party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of any
such court in any such action or proceeding. The Agreement gives
Licensee specific legal rights; Licensee may have others, which vary
from state to state and from country to country.  Trolltech reserves
all rights not specifically granted in this Agreement.
