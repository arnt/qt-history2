FOR PROFESSIONAL AND ENTERPRISE EDITIONS
Version 2.2



IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: This Trolltech End-User License Agreement
("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a
legal entity) ("Licensee") and Trolltech Incorporated ("Trolltech") for the
Trolltech software product(s) accompanying this Agreement, which include(s)
computer software and may include "online" or electronic documentation,
associated media, and printed materials, including the source code, example
programs and the documentation ("Licensed Software").

The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and international
copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and
treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold.

Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into
Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of
which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified
in the license certificate ("License Certificate") accompanying the
Licensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered
part of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict between
the language of this Agreement and the License Certificate, the provisions
of this Agreement shall govern.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software, Licensee
agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee does not
agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may not install, copy, or
otherwise use the Licensed Software; Licensee may, however, return it to
Licensee's place of purchase for a full refund. In addition, by installing,
copying, or otherwise using any updates or other components of the Licensed
Software that Licensee receives separately as part of the Licensed Software
("Updates"), Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional license terms
that accompany such Updates. If Licensee does not agree to the additional
license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not install, copy,
or otherwise use such Updates.

Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed Software in the
manner provided below.

Trolltech grants to Licensee as an individual a personal, nonexclusive,
non-transferable license to make and use copies of the Licensed Software
for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing Licensee's
software product(s) ("Applications"). Licensee may install copies of the
Licensed Software on an unlimited number of computers provided that Licensee
is the only individual using the Licensed Software. If Licensee is an
entity, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to designate one, and only one,
individual within Licensee's organization who shall have the sole right to
use the Licensed Software in the manner provided above. Licensee may at any
time, but not more frequently that once every six (6) months,
designate another individual to replace the current designated user by
notifying Trolltech, so long as there is no more than one designated user at
any given time.

Implementation of all or part of the Licensed Software may require licenses
under third party intellectual property rights, including without limitation,
patent rights. Trolltech is not responsible and shall not be held responsible
in any manner for identifying or failing to identify any or all such third
party intellectual property rights.

of executing Applications permitted under this Agreement that Licensee
has created using the Licensed Software.  Under no circumstances may any
copies of Redistributables be distributed separately.

the general public under terms that are allowed under the Qt Free Edition
license. In addition these parts must have been and be available under
