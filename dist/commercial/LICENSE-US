Qt COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
FOR PROFESSIONAL AND ENTERPRISE EDITIONS
Agreement version 2.5


IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: 
1. This Trolltech End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal
agreement between you (either an individual or a legal entity)
("Licensee") and Trolltech Incorporated ("Trolltech") for the
Trolltech software product(s) accompanying this Agreement, which
include(s) computer software and may include "online" or electronic
documentation, associated media, and printed materials, including the
source code, example programs and the documentation ("Licensed
Software").

2. The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and
international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not
sold.

3. Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into
Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of
which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified
in the license certificate ("License Certificate") accompanying the
Licensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered
part of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict
between the language of this Agreement and the License Certificate,
the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.
 
4. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software,
Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If
Licensee does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may
not install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software; Licensee
may, however, return it to Licensee's place of purchase for a full
refund. In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise using any
updates or other components of the Licensed Software that Licensee
receives separately as part of the Licensed Software ("Updates"),
Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional license terms that
accompany such Updates. If Licensee does not agree to the additional
license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not install,
copy, or otherwise use such Updates.

5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed
Software in the manner provided below.

6. Trolltech grants to Licensee as an individual a personal,
nonexclusive, non- transferable license to make and use copies of the
Licensed Software for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and
testing Licensee's software product(s) ("Applications"). Licensee may
install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited number of
computers provided that Licensee is the only individual using the
Licensed Software. If Licensee is an entity, Trolltech grants Licensee
the right to designate one, and only one, individual within Licensee's
organization who shall have the sole right to use the Licensed
Software in the manner provided above. Licensee may at any time, but
not more frequently that once every six (6) months, designate another
individual to replace the current designated user by notifying
Trolltech, so long as there is no more than one designated user at any
given time.

7. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or
code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to implement various
functions.  Third Party Libraries are not prepared by or owned by
Trolltech, and do not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some
cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be included along with the
Licensed Software delivery as a convenience for development and
testing only. Such source code and libraries as are or may be listed
in the ".../src/3rdparty" source tree delivered with the Licensed
Software, as may be amended from time to time, do not comprise the
Licensed Software.  Licensee acknowledges (1) that some Third Party
Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright and patents
from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution of any of the
Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party Library may
require appropriate licensing from such third parties. Third Party
Libraries include but are not limited to the following categories:
GIF, JPEG and MPEG.

GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES
8. Trolltech grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to
reproduce and distribute the object code form of certain portions of
the Licensed Software ("Redistributables"), as specified in Appendix
1, for execution on any operating system of a type listed in the
License Certificate ("Platforms"). Copies of Redistributables may only
be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing Applications
permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has created using the
Licensed Software.  Under no circumstances may any copies of
Redistributables be distributed separately.

9. The license granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create
Applications and distribute them and the Redistributables (if any) to
Licensee's customers is subject to all of the following conditions:

copyright notice, either Licensee's own or the copyright notice that
appears on the Licensed Software; (ii) Licensee may not remove or
alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice
contained in any portion of the Licensed Software; (iii)
Redistributables, if any, shall be licensed to Licensee's customer "as

LICENSEE'S CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT TO REDISTRIBUTABLES, AND TROLLTECH
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES VIS-A-VIS LICENSEE'S
CUSTOMER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WHETHER OR NOT TROLLTECH KNOWS, HAS REASON TO
KNOW, HAS BEEN ADVISED OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF SUCH PURPOSE); (iv)
Licensee will indemnify and hold Trolltech, its related companies and
its suppliers, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities
arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of Applications;
(v) Applications must be developed using a licensed, registered copy
of the Licensed Software; (vi) Applications must add primary and
substantial functionality to the Licensed Software; (vii) Applications

others to create software with the Licensed Software; (viii)
Applications may not compete with the Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee
may not use Trolltech's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or
trademarks to market the Application(s), except to state that the

NOTE: Qt Free Edition is licensed under the terms of the GPL and not
under this Agreement.  If Licensee has, at any time, developed all (or
any portions of) the Application(s) using Trolltech's publicly
licensed Qt Free Edition, Licensee must comply with Trolltech's
requirements (see http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qt-x11.html)
and license such Application(s) (or any portions derived there from)
under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public
License (the "GPL") a copy of which is located at
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1 (i.e., any Product(s) and/or
parts, components, portions thereof developed using GPL licensed
software, including Qt Free Edition, must be licensed under the terms
of the GPL, and the GPL-based source code must be made available upon
request).

MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TROLLTECH ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS SUPPLIERS, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER NOTWITHSTANDING, LICENSEE MAY HAVE SPECIFIC LEGAL
RIGHTS WHICH MAY VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.


LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
11. IF, TROLLTECH'S WARRANTY DISCLAIMER NOTWITHSTANDING, TROLLTECH IS
HELD LIABLE TO LICENSEE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
THEORY, BASED ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, TROLLTECH'S ENTIRE LIABILITY
TO LICENSEE AND LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE, AT TROLLTECH'S
OPTION, EITHER (A) RETURN OF THE PRICE LICENSEE PAID FOR THE LICENSED
SOFTWARE, OR (B) REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE,
PROVIDED LICENSEE RETURNS TO TROLLTECH ALL COPIES OF THE LICENSED
SOFTWARE AS ORIGINALLY DELIVERED TO LICENSEE. TROLLTECH SHALL NOT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE BASED ON FAILURE OF THE
LICENSED SOFTWARE IF THE FAILURE RESULTED FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE OR
MISAPPLICATION, NOR SHALL TROLLTECH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE
FOR SPECIAL DAMAGES, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, DAMAGES FOR LOSS
OF PROFITS OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR FOR LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF
DATA. ANY AWARD OF DAMAGES FROM TROLLTECH TO LICENSEE SHALL NOT EXCEED

THIS AGREEMENT.

SUPPORT AND UPDATES
12. Licensee will be eligible to receive email based software
developer support and access to Updates to the Licensed Software for a
period not to exceed one year from the date of initial delivery, in
accordance with Trolltech's then current license agreement, policies
and procedures, if any. Such policies and procedures may be changed
from time to time.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

TERMINATION
13. Trolltech may terminate the Agreement at any time immediately upon
written notice by Trolltech to Licensee if Licensee breaches this
Agreement, fails to pay the fees for the Licensed Software, or
infringes Trolltech's intellectual property in or to the Licensed
Software.  Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall return to
Trolltech all copies of Licensed Software that were supplied by
Trolltech.  All other copies of Licensed Software in the possession or
control of Licensee must be erased or destroyed.  An officer of
Licensee must promptly deliver to Trolltech a written confirmation
that this has occurred.

GOVERNMENT END USERS
14. A "U.S. Government End User" shall mean any agency or entity of
the government of the United States.  The following shall apply if
Licensee is a U.S. Government End User.  The Licensed Software is a
"commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101
(Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
"commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used
in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire the Licensed Software with only
those rights set forth herein.  The Licensed Software (including
related documentation) is provided to U.S. Government End Users: (a)
only as a commercial end item; and (b) only pursuant to this
Agreement.

COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS 
15. Licensee shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the Licensed Software in the United States and in other
countries in which Licensee uses or modifies the Licensed Software.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not
export, reexport, disclose or distribute any of the Licensed Software
in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including the
export laws and regulations of the United States, and shall comply
with all such laws and regulations.

16. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by
authorized representatives of Licensee and Trolltech.  In case of a
conflict between the Agreement and the terms of any purchase order or
other ordering document, the Agreement shall prevail.  If any
provision of the Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the
remainder will remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.
If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential
purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set
forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect.

17. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the
laws of the State of California, USA. Any action or proceeding arising
from or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in a federal court
in the Northern District of California or in the State Court in Santa
Clara County, California, and each party irrevocably submits to the
personal jurisdiction of any such court in any such action or
proceeding. The Agreement gives Licensee specific legal rights;
Licensee may have others, which vary from state to state and from
country to country.  Trolltech reserves all rights not specifically
granted in this Agreement.
