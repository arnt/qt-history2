international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual 
property laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not 
sold.

into Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the 
Module of which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee 
are specified in the license certificate ("License Certificate") 
accompanying the Licensed Software. The terms of the License 
Certificate are considered part of the Agreement. In the event of 
inconsistency or conflict between the language of this Agreement 
and the License Certificate, the provisions of this Agreement 
shall govern.

Software, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. 
If Licensee does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee 
should not install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software. 
In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise using any updates 
or other components of the Licensed Software that Licensee may receive 
separately as part of the Licensed Software ("Updates"), Licensee 
agrees to be bound by any additional license terms that accompany 
such Updates. If Licensee does not agree to the additional license 
terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee should not install, copy, 
or otherwise use such Updates. 

5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed 
Software in the manner provided below.


End-User License

6. Trolltech grants to Licensee a nonexclusive, nontransferable 
license to make and use copies of the Licensed Software for the 
sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing Licensee's 
software product(s) ("Application(s)"). Licensee has the right to 
designate one, and only one, individual within Licensee's 
organization ("Designated User") who shall have the sole right to 
use the Licensed Software in the manner provided in this Agreement. 
Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited 
number of computers provided that the Designated User is the only 
individual using the Licensed Software.  Licensee may at any time, 
but not more frequently than once every six (6) months, designate 
another individual to replace the current Designated User by notifying 
Trolltech, so long as there is no more than one Designated User at any 
given time.


Redistribution License

7. The Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise 
dispose of, the Licensed Software or any part thereof, solely or 
as a part of an Application, its source code, in binary/compiled, or 
in any other form ("Redistributables"), except as provided by a 
separate distribution agreement with Trolltech.

8. Notwithstanding the above limitation, the Licensee may 
distribute the Application in binary/compiled form, dynamically 
linked against the Licensed Software, provided the only parts 
of the Licensed Software included in the Application are derived 
from the header files of the Licensed Software, and that no other 
parts of the Licensed Software are distributed in any form.

Generally Applicable Provisions

9. The license granted Licensee in this Agreement for Licensee 
to create and distribute Applications is subject to all of the 
following conditions:  (i) all copies of the Applications Licensee 
creates must bear a valid copyright notice;  (ii) Licensee may not 
remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights 
notice contained in any portion of the Licensed Software;  (iii) 
Redistributables, if any, shall be licensed to Licensee's customers 
"as is"; (iv) Licensee will indemnify and hold Trolltech, its related 
companies and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, 
licensors and suppliers, harmless from and against any claims or 
liabilities arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution 
of Applications and of Redistributables; (v) Applications must be 
developed using a licensed, registered copy of the Licensed Software; 
(vi) Applications must add primary and substantial functionality to 
the Licensed Software; (vii) Applications may not pass on functionality 
which in any way makes it possible for others to create software with 
the Licensed Software; (viii) Applications may not compete with the 
Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee may not use Trolltech's or any of 
its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market Applications, 
except to state that Licensee's program was developed using the Licensed 
Software.

NOTE:  Qt/Embedded Free Edition is licensed under the terms of the 
GPL and not under this Agreement.  If Licensee has, at any time, 
developed all (or any portions of) the Application(s) using 
Trolltech's publicly licensed Qt/Embedded Free Edition, Licensee 
must comply with Trolltech's requirements 
(see http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qt-embedded.html) 
and license such Application(s) (or any portions derived there from) 
under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public 
License (the "GPL") a copy of which is located at 
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1 (i.e., any Product(s) 
and/or parts, components, portions thereof developed using GPL 
licensed software, including Qt/Embedded Free Edition, must be 
licensed under the terms of the GPL, and the GPL-based source code 
must be made available upon request).


10. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party 
libraries or code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to 
implement various functions.  Third Party Libraries are not prepared 
by or owned by Trolltech, and do not comprise part of the Licensed 
Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be 
included along with the Licensed Software delivery as a convenience 
for development and testing only. Such source code and libraries as 
are or may be listed in the "…/src/3rdparty" source tree delivered 
with the Licensed Software, as may be amended from time to time, do 
not comprise the Licensed Software.  Licensee acknowledges (1) that 
some Third Party Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright 
and patents from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution of 
any of the Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party 
Library may require appropriate licensing from such third parties. 
Third Party Libraries include butare not limited to the following 
categories:  GIF, JPEG and MPEG.  

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

conditions, either express or implied, including, but not limited 
to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a 
particular purpose with regard to the Licensed Software. 

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

12. If Trolltech's warranty disclaimer notwithstanding, Trolltech

price Licensee paid for the Licensed Software, or (b) repair or 
replacement of the Licensed Software, provided Licensee returns to 
Trolltech all copies of the Licensed Software as originally

be liable to Licensee based on failure of the Licensed Software if 
the failure resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication, nor 
shall Trolltech under any circumstances be liable for special 
damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for loss of profits 
or interruption of business or for loss or corruption of data. 
Any award of damages from Trolltech to Licensee shall not exceed 
the total amount Licensee has paid to Trolltech in connection with 
this Agreement.

13. Licensee will be eligible to receive email based software 
developer support and access to Updates to the Licensed Software 
for a period not to exceed one year from the date of initial 
delivery, in accordance with Trolltech's then current policies 
and procedures, if any. Such policies and procedures may be 
changed from time to time.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

14. Trolltech may terminate the Agreement at any time immediately 
upon written notice byTrolltech to Licensee if Licensee breaches 
this Agreement, fails to pay the fees for the Licensed Software,

terms. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its 
essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of
