this Agreement. Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an
unlimited number of computers provided that the Designated User is the only
individual using the Licensed Software.  Licensee may at any time, but not
more frequently than once every six (6) months, designate another
individual to replace the current Designated User by notifying Trolltech,

agreement with Trolltech.

Notwithstanding the above limitation, the Licensee may distribute the
Product in binary/compiled form, dynamically linked against the Licensed
