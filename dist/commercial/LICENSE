Qt COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
Agreement version 3.0 

IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: 

1. This Trolltech End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal
agreement between you (either an individual or a legal entity)
("Licensee") and Trolltech AS ("Trolltech") for the Trolltech software
product(s) accompanying this Agreement, which include(s) computer
software and may include "online" or electronic documentation,
associated media, and printed materials, including the source code,
example programs and the documentation ("Licensed Software").

2. The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and
international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not
sold.

3. Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into
Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of
which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified
in the license certificate ("License Certificate") accompanying the
Licensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered
part of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict
between the language of this Agreement and the License Certificate,
the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

4. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software,
Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If
Licensee does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may
not install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software. Licensee
may, however, return it to Licensee's place of purchase within 14 days
of purchase for a full refund. In addition, by installing, copying, or
otherwise using any updates or other components of the Licensed
Software that Licensee receives separately as part of the Licensed
Software ("Updates"), Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional
license terms that accompany such Updates. If Licensee does not agree
to the additional license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee
may not install, copy, or otherwise use such Updates.

5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed
Software in the manner provided below.

6. Trolltech grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
perpetual license to make, use and modify copies of the Licensed
Software for the maximum number of named individuals within Licensee's
organization ("Named User"(s)) specified in the License Certificate
for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing Licensee's
software product(s), which may include the Licensed Software
("Applications"). Modified Licensed Software shall be considered as
Licensed Software for the purposes of this Agreement.

7. Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an
unlimited number of computers provided that only the Named Users use
the Licensed Software. Licensee may at any time designate another
Named User within Licensee's organization to replace a then-current
Named User by notifying Trolltech, provided that a) the then-current
Named User has not been designated as a replacement during the last
six (6) months; and b) there is no more than the specified number of
Named Users at any given time.

8. Verification: Trolltech or a certified auditor on Trolltech's
behalf, may, upon its reasonable request and at its expense, audit
Licensee with respect to the use of the Licensed Software. Any such
audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's
facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's
business activities. Trolltech will not remove, copy, or redistribute
any electronic material during the course of an audit. Licensee does
not implicitly grant Trolltech any form of license agreement. If an
audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software in a way
that is in material violation of the terms of the Agreement, then
Licensee shall pay Trolltech's reasonable costs of conducting the
audit. In the case of a material violation, Licensee agrees to pay
Trolltech any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized
use. In the alternative, Trolltech reserves the right, at Trolltech's
sole option, to terminate the licenses for the Licensed Software.

9. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or
code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to implement various
functions. Third Party Libraries do not comprise part of the Licensed
Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be
included along with the Licensed Software delivery as a convenience
for development and testing only. Such source code and libraries as
are or may be listed in the ".../src/3rdparty" source tree delivered
with the Licensed Software, as may be amended from time to time, do
not comprise the Licensed Software. Licensee acknowledges (1) that
some Third Party Libraries may require additional licensing of
copyright and patents from the owners of such, and (2) that
distribution of any of the Licensed Software referencing any portion
of a Third Party Library may require appropriate licensing from such
third parties.

GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES
10. a) Trolltech grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to
reproduce and distribute the object code form of certain portions of
the Licensed Software ("Redistributables"), as specified in Appendix
1, Section 1, for execution on any operating system of a type listed
in the License Certificate ("Platforms"). Copies of Redistributables
may only be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing
Applications permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has created
using the Licensed Software. Under no circumstances may any copies of
Redistributables be distributed separately. This Agreement does not
give Licensee any rights to distribute any of the parts of the
Licensed Software listed in Appendix 1, Section 2, neither as a whole
nor as parts or snippets of code.

b) Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose
of Redistributables, solely or as part of an Application, its source
code, in binary/compiled form, or in any other form, if such action is
part of a joint software and hardware distribution, except as set
forth below or provided by a separate runtime distribution license
with Trolltech or one of its authorized distributors. A joint hardware
and software distribution shall be defined as either: (i) distribution
of a hardware device that includes the Licensed Software; or (ii)
distribution of the Licensed Software onto a device designed to
facilitate the installation of the Licensed Software onto the same
device and where the core functionality of the device will depend on
the Licensed Software.

c) If the combination of the Licensed Software and hardware and/or
software ("Product"), in the final working end-user configuration
either (i) relies on Apple OS X (R) or Windows 98/ME/2000/2003/ XP/Vista
(R) (however not including embedded versions of these, e.g XP Embedded)
as an integral part of and foundation for its functionality; or (ii)
is a workstation, server, desktop computer or notebook computer
relying on a complete 3rd party desktop environment such as KDE or
GNOME as an integral part of and foundation for its functionality; or
(iii) only depends on modules in the Licensed Software's Console
edition (Qt Core, Database, Network, XML) and is not dependent on a
window system (such as the X Windows system or similar) to operate; or
(iv) requires a permanent mains power supply for normal operation; or
(v) does not lose core functionality when the Licensed Software is
removed, then Licensee is hereby granted an exception from the
requirement for a runtime distribution license agreement.

d) In all instances not covered above, Licensee shall contact
Trolltech or one of Trolltech's authorized distributors to obtain a
distribution license agreement.

11. The license granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create
Applications and distribute them and the Redistributables (if any) to
Licensee's customers is subject to all of the following conditions:
(i) all copies of the Applications Licensee creates must bear a valid
copyright notice, either Licensee's own or the copyright notice that
appears on the Licensed Software; (ii) Licensee may not remove or
alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice
contained in any portion of the Licensed Software, including but not
limited to the About Boxes in "Qt Assistant" and "Qt Linguist" as
defined in Appendix 1; (iii) Redistributables, if any, shall be
licensed to Licensee's customer "as is"; (iv) Licensee will indemnify
and hold Trolltech, its related companies and its suppliers, harmless
from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of the use,
reproduction or distribution of Applications; (v) Applications must be
developed using a licensed, registered copy of the Licensed Software;
(vi) Applications must add primary and substantial functionality to
the Licensed Software; (vii) Applications may not pass on
functionality which in any way makes it possible for others to create
software with the Licensed Software; (viii) Applications may not
compete with the Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee may not use
Trolltech's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to
market Application(s), except to state that Application was developed
using the Licensed Software.

NOTE: Qt Open Source Edition is licensed under the terms of the GPL
and not under this Agreement. If Licensee has, at any time, developed
all (or any portions of) the Application(s) using Trolltech's publicly
licensed Qt Open Source Edition, Licensee must comply with Trolltech's
requirements (see
http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qt-x11.html) and license
such Application(s) (or any portions derived there from) under the
terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License
version 2 (the "GPL") a copy of which is located at
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1 (i.e., any Product(s) and/or
parts, components, portions thereof developed using GPL licensed
software, including Qt Open Source Edition, must be licensed under the
terms of the GPL, and the GPL-based source code must be made available
upon request).

12. Warranty Disclaimer: The Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee
"as is". To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Trolltech
on behalf of itself and its suppliers, disclaims all warranties and
conditions, either express or implied, including, but not limited to,
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, title and non-infringement with regard to the Licensed
Software.

13. Limitation of Liability: If, Trolltech's warranty disclaimer
notwithstanding, Trolltech is held liable to Licensee, whether in
contract, tort or any other legal theory, based on the Licensed
Software, Trolltech's entire liability to Licensee and Licensee's
exclusive remedy shall be, at Trolltech's option, either (A) return of
the price Licensee paid for the Licensed Software, or (B) repair or
replacement of the Licensed Software, provided Licensee returns to
Trolltech all copies of the Licensed Software as originally delivered
to Licensee. Trolltech shall not under any circumstances be liable to
Licensee based on failure of the Licensed Software if the failure
resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication, nor shall Trolltech
under any circumstances be liable for special damages, punitive or
exemplary damages, damages for loss of profits or interruption of
business or for loss or corruption of data. Any award of damages from
Trolltech to Licensee shall not exceed the total amount Licensee has
paid to Trolltech in connection with this Agreement.

14. Support and Updates: Licensee will be eligible to receive email
based software developer support and access to Updates ("Support and
Updates") to the Licensed Software for a period not to exceed one year
from the date of initial delivery ("Initial Term"), in accordance with
Trolltech's then current policies and procedures, if any. Such
policies and procedures may be changed from time to time. Following
the Initial Term, Trolltech will no longer make the Licensed Software
available to Licensee unless Licensee purchases additional Support and
Updates according to section 15 below.

15. Renewal of Support and Updates: Licensee may purchase additional
Support and Updates following the Initial Term at Trolltech's terms
and conditions applicable at the time of renewal.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

16. Licensee Name: Trolltech may include Licensee's company name in a
publicly available list of Trolltech customers.

17. No Assignment: Neither this Agreement nor Licensee's rights under
this Agreement are assignable or transferable by Licensee either in
whole or in part to any third party without Trolltech's written
consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the
foregoing shall be void. Trolltech may assign or transfer this
Agreement to any third party who acquires substantially all of
Trolltech copyrights in and to the Licensed Software.

18. Termination: Trolltech may terminate the Agreement at any time
immediately upon written notice by Trolltech to Licensee if Licensee
breaches this Agreement, fails to pay the fees for the Licensed
Software, or infringes Trolltech's intellectual property in or to the
Licensed Software. Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall
return to Trolltech all copies of Licensed Software that were supplied
by Trolltech. All other copies of Licensed Software in the possession
or control of Licensee must be erased or destroyed. An officer of
Licensee must promptly deliver to Trolltech a written confirmation
that this has occurred.

19. Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the complete
agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written
or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein. No
modification of this Agreement will be effective unless contained in a
writing executed by an authorized representative of each party. No
term or condition contained in Licensee's purchase order will apply
unless expressly accepted by Trolltech in writing. If any provision of
the Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the remainder will
remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any remedy
provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all
limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this
Agreement shall remain in effect.
