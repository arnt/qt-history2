                   FOR PROFESSIONAL AND ENTERPRISE EDITIONS

Copyright (C) 1999-2000 Trolltech AS.  All rights reserved.

This non-exclusive non-transferable License Agreement is between you
("Licensee") and Trolltech AS, and pertains to all files in the
Qt GUI Toolkit ("Software"), including the source code, example programs
and the documentation.


                        COPYRIGHT AND RESTRICTIONS

1. All intellectual property rights in the Software are owned by Troll
Tech AS and are protected by Norwegian copyright laws, other applicable
copyright laws, and international treaty provisions. Trolltech AS retains
all rights not expressly granted. No title, property rights or copyright
in the Software or in any modifications to the Software shall pass to the
Licensee under any circumstances.

2. The Licensee may not loan, rent, lease, or license the Software or any
copy. The Licensee may not alter or remove any details of ownership,
copyright, trade mark or other property right connected with the
Software. The Licensee may not disclose any source code or any concepts
and methods therein for any purpose other than as specifically provided
in this Agreement.

3. Some groups of files in the Software are designated as Modules. These
files contain specific notices defining the Module of which they are a
part. The Licensed Modules are those Modules of the Software specified
in the license certificate. The files of the Software which are not part
of any Module will herein be referred to as the Base Software.

4. The Licensee may use the Base Software and the Licensed Modules on the
platform(s) specified in the license certificate, to develop any kind of
product, except products which would compete with the Software. A product
that satisfies this section will herein be referred to as the Product.

5. The Licensee may distribute, without restrictions, and without paying
royalties or run-time fees, the Product in any form, including
executables statically or dynamically linked with the Software. This
does not grant the Licensee the right to disclose any source code of
the Software.

6. The Licensee may also distribute, together with the Product, the
Software in the form of a shared/dynamic link library, provided that the
recipient is allowed to use such library for runtime linking with the
Product only.

7. The Licensee may modify the Base Software and the Licensed Modules.
The modified result is governed by this License Agreement as Software.


                         LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED
HEREIN, TROLLTECH AS MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THEIR
QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOFTWARE IS WITH THE LICENSEE.

Because software is inherently complex and may not be completely free of
errors, the Licensee is advised to verify his work and make backup copies
where appropriate. In no event will Trolltech AS be liable for any
damages whatsoever including - but not restricted to - lost revenue or
profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental, cover, or
consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the
Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, except to
the extent invariable law, if any, provides otherwise.
