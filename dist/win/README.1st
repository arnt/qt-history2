		       IMPORTANT NOTES FOR QT/WIN32


For technical reasons, Qt now consists of the two libraries qt.lib and
qtmain.lib instead of just one library.

To link your applications with this version of Qt, you will need to
modify your makefiles: add qtmain.lib to the link step.

Alternatively, you can use tmake 1.2 beta which you can download from
ftp://ftp.troll.no/freebies/tmake
