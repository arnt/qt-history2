                        PORTING QT TO OTHER PLATFORMS

Read this file if you want to port Qt to other NT platforms or C++
compilers. Our internal development environment is Windows 95 and NT
with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC++) 4.2 and 5.0 on Intel.


                               REQUIREMENTS

Qt requires that your C++ compiler supports multiple inheritance.
Template support is strongly recommended, but not a necessity.  The
compiler must recognize the .cpp extension.  Exception handling and RTTI
(Run-Time Type Information) are not required.  Expect problems with old
CFront-based compilers.

                                 PATCHES

Please send us the patches you had to make so we can add them to the code
base; then we can support the new platform in an orderly manner.

                           PORTING INSTRUCTIONS

You are strongly recommended to use the tmake utility (see README.tmake)
to write your makefiles. tmake is a multi-platform, template-based
makefile generator that is very easy to use.

In qglobal.h you may need to set _CC_whatever_ for your compiler. It is
not strictly required, but it may be necessary to add some #ifdefs for
your compiler to compile the source.

If your compiler doesn't support templates, make sure DEFAULT_MACROCLASS
is defined in qglobal.h.

There are also some size-dependent types (UINT32 and so on), make sure
they're right for your system.

Some compilers emit bad warnings when they compile Qt.  If yours does, and
the code in Qt is sane, please use a #pragma or two to shut your compiler
up.  (This is a good reason for wanting the _CC_whatever_ define above.)

Good luck, and feel free to send mail to qt-bugs@troll.no.
