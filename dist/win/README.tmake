                                  TMAKE

tmake is a tool for creating platform-independent makefiles. In brief,
tmake reads a project file, combines it with a template and generates
a makefile.

The .pro files in the Qt distribution are project files for tmake.
To create a makefile from a .pro file, do the following:

	tmake tetris.pro -o tetris.mak

This assumes that the TMAKEPATH environment variable contains the
directory where your compiler's template files are stored (for example
c:\tmake\lib\win32-watcom).

Get the latest version of tmake from ftp://ftp.troll.no/contrib/ .
You need perl version 5 (110-i86.zip) or later to run tmake.

To install tmake, unzip the tmake zip archive (for instance on c:\) and
read the documentation tmake\doc\tmake.html with your HTML browser.
