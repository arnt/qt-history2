Getting Started with Qt Professional Edition for Windows
========================================================

We at Troll Tech would first like to thank you for choosing Qt for
developing your Windows software.

Now that you have installed the Qt Professional Edition, you will need to
build the Qt library before you can develop Qt programs.
The setup program has installed makefiles for your chosen compiler. The
qt\mkfiles directory contains several makefile sets in zipped archives.


GIF Support in Qt
-----------------

GIF image reading support in Qt is disabled by default.  If you want to
enable built-in GIF image reading in Qt, consult the header file qgif.h
in the qt\include directory.


Build the Qt Library and Example Programs
-----------------------------------------

To build the Qt library, run the shortcut "Build the Qt library" in the Qt
folder in "Start menu -> Programs".

The Qt folder also contains shortcuts to build the example programs and
the tutorial.

Alternatively, you can build these targets from either a command prompt
using the make program that comes with your compiler, or import the
Makefile into your favorite IDE.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If the compilation fails because the moc.exe program cannot be found or
the Qt header files are missing, check if the PATH contains the Qt\bin
directory and the environment variable QTDIR has been set.  After
installing Qt, you may need to reboot your computer to make sure these
settings are applied.

If the compilation fails because the compiler cannot find the system
header files (e.g. stdio.h or windows.h), you must set the INCLUDE and LIB
environment variables to contain the paths of the compiler's header files
and library files.  For Microsoft Visual C++ users, run the vcvars32.bat
file to setup the environment.


The Qt Reference Manual
-----------------------

The Qt reference documentation is installed in the qt\doc directory
(unless you chose not to install it.)  The Qt folder in "Start menu ->
Programs" contains a shortcut to browse the documentation.

If you are new to Qt programming, we recommend that you check out the
tutorial section and the example programs. Another good source of
information is the book "Programming with Qt" book published by O'Reilly
(ISBN 1-56592-588-2), which covers elementary to advanced topics in Qt
programming.

The documentation is also available as postscript from

Create Makefiles with tmake
---------------------------

If you want to spend less time writing your own makefiles or you need to
maintain makefiles for several platforms, download and install the free
tmake utility from Troll Tech.  tmake is an easy-to-use tool for creating
and maintaining makefiles across many platforms and compilers.

tmake reads a special tmake project file (.pro) and creates a makefile for
your operating system and compiler.  A project file typically looks like
this (qt\examples\hello\hello.pro):

      TEMPLATE  = app
      CONFIG    = qt warn_on release
      HEADERS   = hello.h
      SOURCES   = hello.cpp \
                  main.cpp
      TARGET    = hello

To create a makefile for Borland C++, set the TMAKEPATH environment
variable to "C:\tmake\lib\win32-borland" and run the tmake program:

      C:\qt\examples\hello> tmake hello.pro -o Makefile

tmake can create makefiles for Windows and all popular Unix systems and
supports more than 15 different C/C++ compilers and is therefore ideal
for cross-platform software development.  tmake can also create project
files (.dsp files) for Microsoft Developer Studio.


Reporting Bugs, Mailing List and Support
----------------------------------------

If you find any bugs, send a report to qt-bugs@troll.no.  If you want
to join the Qt development mailing list, send a mail to
qt-interest-request@troll.no containing the single word "subscribe".
Support questions can be emailed to support@troll.no.
