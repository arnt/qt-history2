                        HOW TO INSTALL Qt FOR WINDOWS


1.  Unzip the qtwin%VERSIONWIN%.zip file, unless you already have.
    If you don't already have unzip, WinZip or another zip program,
    you can download and install ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/util/infozip.exe.

	c:
	cd \
	unzip qtwin%VERSIONWIN%.zip

    This creates the directory C:\qt.


2.  Set some environment variables in AUTOEXEC.BAT or via "System"
    in "Control Panel" (Windows NT and Windows 2000):

    The QTDIR variable says where Qt is installed, for example:

	QTDIR=c:\qt

    Note: The path must not include directories that contain space(s)
    in their names, like e.g. "Program Files".

    You must also set the PATH to locate applications like moc.exe, uic.exe, etc.

	PATH=%QTDIR%\bin;%PATH%

    You can also set environment variables supported by many compilers:

	INCLUDE=%QTDIR%\include;%INCLUDE%
	LIB=%QTDIR%\lib;%LIB%

    Restart the computer to make sure these settings are applied.


3.  Qt comes with makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++ and Borland C++.
    The default makefiles are for Microsoft Visual C++.
    If you use Borland C++, you will need to install other makefiles.

    For Borland C++ users:

	cd qt
	unzip mkfiles\borland.zip

    If you want a multithreaded library for Borland C++, you have to do:

	cd qt
	unzip mkfiles\borland-mt.zip

    A shared Qt library (DLL) for Borland C++ is not supported at the
    moment.

    If you use Microsoft Visual C++ and want to create a shared Qt
    library (DLL), you have to do:

	cd qt
	unzip mkfiles\msvc-dll.zip

    If you want to build a Qt library with multithreading support for
    Microsoft Visual C++, you have to do (for a static Qt library):

	cd qt
	unzip mkfiles\msvc-mt.zip

    or (for a shared Qt library):

	cd qt
	unzip mkfiles\msvc-dll-mt.zip


4.  You are now ready to compile the Qt library:

	cd qt
	nmake		(or "make" for Borland C++ users)

    The qt.lib and qtmain.lib or qt.dll files (depending on the
    configuration you have chosen) are created in the qt\lib
    directory.
    moc.exe, designer.exe, uic.exe and some other programs are
    now in the qt\bin directory. 

    The designer and uic are not compiled by default, as pre-compiled
    static linked versions of these two programs are included in the
    package already. If you want to build these two programs (e.g. so
    that they use the qt.dll), go into qt/tools/designer and type
    nmake (or make for Borland C++users).


We recommend that you use tmake from Trolltech to create makefiles. This
is a free tool which eliminates the hassle of writing and maintaining
makefiles across different platforms and compilers.  See README.tmake for
more information.

That is all.  Qt and the Qt Designer is now installed.
