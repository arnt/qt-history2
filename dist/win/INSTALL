                        HOW TO INSTALL Qt FOR WINDOWS


    There are two ways to install Qt on your computer:

    A) Let the install program do the work.
    B) Do the process manually.

    We recommend that you use installation program, but we describe the
    manual procedure as well, in case the installation should fail for some
    reason.

A   USING THE INSTALLATION PROGRAM

    Start the install.exe program and go through all the steps of
    installation wizard:

    1. Read the license. You are only able to continue the installation if
       you accept the license.

    2. Select where you want to install Qt and which parts of Qt you want
       to install. You also have to slect which development tools you want
       to use with Qt. The wizard allows you to select only one, but you
       may set the system up to use any other development system later.

    3. Enter your license information -- either type it in, or let the
       installation program read it from the Qt license file you have
       received with your Qt package.

    4. Choose which program menu folder Qt should install its icons to.

       The checkbox for setting QTDIR is to choose whether or not the
       environment variable QTDIR should be set or modified.  If checked,
       QTDIR will be set to point to the directory where you installed Qt.
       If QTDIR is already set, (Qt is already installed, maybe another
       version) this checkbox will be cleared by default, to avoid
       accidental modifications to your setup.

       If you have chosen to use Microsoft Visual Studio, you must also
       specify the path to the installation of Microsoft Visual Studio.
       This allows Qt to integrate itself into the development environment

    5. Configuration of the library: you can choose several options and
       configurations for building the Qt library. The default options
       should be sufficient for most of the time. The library may also be
       reconfigured later.

    After this, the wizard copies the files into the installation
    directory, and compiles the toolkit. Logs of both the file copy and
    building are saved to the installation directory. If you selected
    Microsoft Visual Studio as your development environment, the wizard
    also makes an integration of the Qt tools into Visual Studio.

    NOTE: When installing the toolkit on a Windows 9X system, the
    compilation step is skipped, due to technical limitations in the
    operating system. The installation program writes the steps needed to
    build the toolkit into a batch file and puts a shortcut to this in the
    start menu. To build it, just click on this shortcut.

    Some operating system versions may require a reboot before all
    environment variables are activated.


B   BUILDING THE LIBRARY MANUALLY

    Here are step by step instructions on how to build Qt manually.

    1. Uncompress the files into the directory you want to use, e.g.
       C:\Qt\3.0.0\

    2. You need to set up certain environment variables for Qt:

       a. Set QTDIR to the directory where the Qt files have been
	  installed. All other paths needed by the build system or Qt
	  development tools will be derived from this variable.

       b. Set QMAKESPEC to win32-msvc if you want to build Qt with
	  Microsoft Visual Studio or set it to win32-borland if you want to
	  build Qt with Borland Builder. (See the mkspecs directory for a
	  complete list of which systems are available.)

       c. Extend your PATH variable by %QTDIR%\bin to make sure that the Qt
          tools are found.

    4. The next step is to configure your Qt library:

       a. Change the directory in the command prompt to the directory where
          you unpacked the Qt files ("cd %QTDIR%").

       b. Execute the configure tool in the command prompt with the desired
	  options. For example, use "configure -release -shared" to build
	  Qt as a shared library, without debug information.

	  Type "configure -help" to get a list of all available options

	  The configure tool scans through all the Qt files, and generates
	  makefiles for your configuration.

    5. The actual commands needed to build Qt depends on your development
       system. For Microsoft Visual Studio, type the command "nmake" in the
       command prompt and for Borland type "make". This builds all the
       different parts of the toolkit.

    That is all. Qt and the Qt Designer are now installed.
