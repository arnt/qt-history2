                          INSTALLING Qt/Windows Version %VERSION%

1.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, copy the license file
    from your account on dist.trolltech.com into your home directory
    (this may be known as the userprofile environment variable) and
    rename it to .qt-license. For example on Windows 2000,
    %USERPROFILE% should be something like C:\Documents and
    Settings\username

    For the open source version you do not need a license file.

2.  Uncompress the files into the directory you want Qt installed,
    e.g. C:\Qt\%VERSION%

3.  Building

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type:

	C:
	cd \Qt\%VERSION%
	configure

    Type "configure -help" to get a list of all available options.

    The actual commands needed to build Qt depends on your development
    system. For Microsoft Visual Studio to create the library and
    compile all the demos, examples, tools and tutorials type:

	nmake

4. Environment variables

   In order to use Qt, some environment variables needs to be
   extended.

	PATH		   - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools

   This is done by adding c:\Qt\%VERSION%\bin to the PATH variable.

   For newer versions of Windows, PATH can be extended through
   "Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment variables" and for
   older versions by editing c:\autoexec.bat.

That's all.  Qt is now installed.
