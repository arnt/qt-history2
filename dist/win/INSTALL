                          INSTALLING Qt/Windows Version %VERSION%

Note: If you have obtained a binary package for this platform, consult the
installation instructions provided instead of the ones in this document.

1.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, copy the license file
    from your account on dist.trolltech.com into your home directory
    (this may be known as the userprofile environment variable) and
    rename it to .qt-license. For example on Windows 2000,
    %USERPROFILE% should be something like C:\Documents and
    Settings\username

    For the open source version you do not need a license file.

2.  Uncompress the files into the directory you want Qt installed,
    e.g. C:\Qt\%VERSION%. 

    NOTE: The install path must not contain any spaces.

3. Environment variables

   In order to build and use Qt, the PATH environment variable needs
   to be extended:

        PATH               - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools

   This is done by adding c:\Qt\%VERSION%\bin to the PATH variable.

   For newer versions of Windows, PATH can be extended through
   "Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment variables" and for
   older versions by editing c:\autoexec.bat.

4.  Building

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type:

        C:
        cd \Qt\%VERSION%
        configure

    Type "configure -help" to get a list of all available options.

    The actual commands needed to build Qt depends on your development
    system. For Microsoft Visual Studio to create the library and
    compile all the demos, examples, tools and tutorials type:

        nmake

    If you need to reconfigure and rebuild Qt from the same location,
    ensure that all traces of the previous configuration are removed
    by entering the build directory and typing

        nmake confclean

    before running the configure script again.

5.  That's all. Qt is now installed.

    If you are new to Qt, we suggest that you take a look at the demos
    and examples to see Qt in action. Run the Qt Examples and Demos
    either by typing 'qtdemo' on the command line or through the
    desktop's Start menu.
