			   INSTALLING Qt/Windows

    The Qt Technology Preview must be built manually. Please follow the
    following steps:

    1. Uncompress the files into the directory you want to use, e.g.
       C:\Qt\4.0.0-beta

    2. Copy the license file from your account on dist.trolltech.com
       into your home directory (this may be known as the userprofile
       environment variable) and rename it to .qt-license 

       For example on Windows 2000, %USERPROFILE% should be something
       like c:\documents and settings\username

    3. You need to set up certain environment variables for Qt:

       a. Set QTDIR to the directory where the Qt files have been
	  installed. All other paths needed by the build system or Qt
	  development tools will be derived from this variable.

       b. Set QMAKESPEC depending on the compiler you are using to build Qt.
	    - Microsoft Visual Studio: 		win32-msvc
	    - Microsoft Visual Studio .NET: 	win32-msvc.net
	    - Intel C++ Compiler: 		win32-icc
	    - MingGW: 				win32-g++
          Other compilers are not supported for the tech preview.

       c. Extend your PATH variable by %QTDIR%\bin to make sure that the Qt
          tools are found.

    4. The next step is to configure your Qt library:

       a. Change the directory in the command prompt to the directory where
          you unpacked the Qt files ("cd %QTDIR%").

       b. Execute the configure tool in the command prompt with the desired
	  options. For example, use "configure -release -shared" to build
	  Qt as a shared library, without debug information.

	  Type "configure -help" to get a list of all available options

	  The configure tool scans through all the Qt files, and generates
	  makefiles for your configuration.

    5. The actual commands needed to build Qt depends on your development
       system. For Microsoft Visual Studio, type the command "nmake"
       at the command prompt. This builds all the different parts of the
       toolkit.

    Qt should now be built and installed.
