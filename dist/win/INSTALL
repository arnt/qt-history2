                        HOW TO INSTALL Qt FOR WINDOWS


    There are two ways to install Qt on your computer:
    a) Let the install program do the work.
    b) Do the process manually.

    We recommend that you let the installation program do the work,
    but we will describe the manual procedure as well, in case the
    installation should fail for some reason.

A   USING THE INSTALLATION PROGRAM

    This should be straightforward.
    1. Select where you want the files installed, and which development
       tools you will be using with Qt. The wizard will only let you
       select one, but you may set the system up to use any other
       development system later.

    2. Enter your license information.
       Either type it in, or let the installation program read it
       from the Qt license file you have received.

    3. Choose which program menu folder Qt should install its icons
       to.
       The checkbox for setting QTDIR is to choose whether or not
       the environment variable QTDIR should be set or modified.
       If checked, QTDIR will be set to point to the directory where
       you installed Qt.
       If QTDIR is already set, (Qt is already installed, maybe another
       version) this checkbox will be cleared by default, to avoid
       accidental modifications to your setup.

    4. Configuration of the library.
       On the next page you will get the opportunity to configure the
       library.  For most people, the defaults will be OK, but in case
       you need a special configuration, now is your chance.
       The library may also be reconfigured later.

    After this, the files will be copied into the installation directory,
    and the toolkit will be compiled.  Logs of both the file copy and
    building will be saved to the installation directory, to be reviewed
    later.

    NOTE: When installing the toolkit on a Windows 9X system, the
    compilation step will be skipped.  Due to technical limitations in
    the operating system, the installation program will write the
    steps needed to build the toolkit into a batch file, and put a shortcut
    to this in the start menu.  To build it, just click on this shortcut.

    Some operating system versions may require a reboot before all
    environment variables are activated.


B   BUILDING THE LIBRARY MANUALLY

    Here are step by step instructions on how to build Qt manually.
    Get the files uncompressed into the directory you want to use,
    e.g. C:\Qt\3.0.0\

    1. First you need to set up the environment variables for Qt.
       QTDIR should be set to the directory where the Qt files have been
       installed.  All other paths needed by the build system or Qt development
       tools will be derived from this variable.
       QMAKESPEC should be set to the development system you will be using.
       See the mkspecs directory for a list of which systems are available.
       When setting QMAKESPEC, you should only use the name of the directory,
       e.g. "win32-msvc", and not the complete path.
    
    2. Add Qt to the PATH variable.
       Add %QTDIR%\bin and %QTDIR%\lib to your path.
    
    3. To build Qt the first time, you should be able to use development
       systems command line tools.  Depending on your system and configuration
       this may have to be set up.  Microsoft Visual Studio keeps a batch
       file in VC98\BIN\VCVARS32.BAT to be used for this purpose.

    4. After all the environment variables have been set up, you may continue
       with the configuration step.
       The first step is to CD into the QTDIR directory.
       Qt 3.0 features a configure tool, that makes this process a lot easier
       than with earlier versions of the toolkit.
       To review the available options, type "configure -help" on the command
       line.
       To build Qt as a shared library, without debug information, the command
       would be "configure -release -shared".

       The configure tool will scan through all the Qt files, and generate
       makefiles as appropriate for your configuration.  When it is done,
       you may continue with the build step.

    5. The actual commands needed to build Qt depends on your development system.
       For Visual C++, the command is "nmake", while Borland uses "make".
       This will build all the different parts of the toolkit.



    That is all.  Qt and the Qt Designer is now installed.
