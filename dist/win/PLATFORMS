Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" program to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option, or set the QMAKESPEC
environment variable to specify the operating system and compiler you
are using.  

Supported platforms and compilers:

  win32-borland
  win32-g++
  win32-msvc
  win32-msvc.net 

Compilation problems:

  Qt 3.x has problems compiling on some combinations of operating
  system versions and compiler versions.  Information about such
  problems will be posted on http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/
  as we become aware of them.

Example:

  configure -platform win32-msvc.net -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files
  to the mkspecs directory.  Use existing similar configurations
  as a starting point.

  NOTE:
  Custom configuration will disable the generation of MSVC specific
  project files, nmake and borland makefiles.  General makefiles will
  be generated instead.
