Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  aix-g++        hpux-acc       irix-n32       osf1-g++       ultrix-g++
  aix-xlc        hpux-cc        irix-o32       qnx-g++        unixware-g++
  bsdi-g++       hpux-g++       linux-g++      sco-g++        unixware7-cc
  dgux-g++       irix-64        netbsd-g++     solaris-cc     unixware7-g++
  freebsd-g++    irix-dcc       openbsd-g++    solaris-g++
  gnu-g++        irix-g++       osf1-cxx       sunos-g++

Limitations:

  aix-g++ and ultrix-g++ do not support shared libraries, use static.

Compilation problems:

  Qt 2.0 has problems compiling on some combinations of operating
  system versions and compiler versions.  We do not yet know the full
  extent of these problems, but see http://www.troll.no/platforms/

Example:

  ./configure -platform irix-64 -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files to
  the configs directory. The configuration solaris-cc-gcc is included
  as an example. It uses SunPRO CC as a C++ compiler and GNU gcc as a
  C compiler.
