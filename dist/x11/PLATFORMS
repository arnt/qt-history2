Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  aix-g++
  aix-xlc
  aix-xlc-64
  freebsd-g++
  freebsd-icc
  hpux-acc
  hpux-g++
  irix-cc
  irix-cc-64
  irix-g++
  linux-ecc-64
  linux-g++
  linux-icc
  solaris-cc
  solaris-cc-64
  solaris-g++
  solaris-g++-64
  tru64-g++

Compilation problems:

  If you experience problems compiling Qt 4.x consult the platform
  notes found at http://www.trolltech.com/developer/platforms/ where
  we post workarounds and known issues as we become aware of them.

Example:

  ./configure -platform linux-g++ -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files
  to the mkspecs directory.  Use existing similar configurations
  as a starting point.


Note regarding accelerated XRender support:

Users that have an accelerated XRender extension should add the
following section to their ~/.settings/trolltech.com.conf file:

[Qt]
hasAcceleratedXrender=true

This should improve the accelerated XRender performance noticeably.
