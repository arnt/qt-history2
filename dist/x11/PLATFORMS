Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  aix-g++        hpux-g++       irix-cc-o32    reliant-64     tru64-g++
  aix-xlc        hpux-n64       linux-g++      reliant-cds    ultrix-g++
  bsdi-g++       hpux-o64       linux-cxx      sco-g++        unixware-g++
  dgux-g++       hurd-g++       linux-kcc      solaris-64     unixware7-cc
  freebsd-g++    irix-g++       netbsd-g++     solaris-cc     unixware7-g++
  hpux-acc       irix-cc        openbsd-g++    solaris-g++
  hpux-cc        irix-cc-64     qnx-g++        tru64-cxx

Limitations:

  ultrix-g++ does not support shared libraries, use static.
  qnx-g++ is experimental only. Expect some problems.

Compilation problems:

  Qt 3.x has problems compiling on some combinations of operating
  system versions and compiler versions.  Information about such
  problems will be posted on http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/
  as we become aware of them.

Example:

  ./configure -platform irix-cc-64 -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files
  to the mkspecs directory.  Use existing similar configurations
  as a starting point.
