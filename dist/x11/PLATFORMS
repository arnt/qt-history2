Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  aix-g++
  aix-xlc
  aix-xlc-64
  freebsd-g++
  freebsd-icc
  hpux-acc
  hpux-g++
  irix-cc
  irix-cc-64
  irix-g++
  linux-g++
  linux-icc
  solaris-cc
  solaris-cc-64
  solaris-g++
  solaris-g++-64

Compilation problems:

  If you experience problems compiling Qt 4.x consult the platform
  notes found at http://www.trolltech.com/developer/platforms/ where
  we post workarounds and known issues as we become aware of them.

Example:

  ./configure -platform linux-g++ -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files
  to the mkspecs directory.  Use existing similar configurations
  as a starting point.


Note regarding RENDER support:

Testing has shown that when using a video driver without accelerated
RENDER support, drawing performance can be improved by adding the
following section to their ~/.config/Trolltech.conf file:

[Qt]
reuseDoubleBuffer=false

At this time, we are uncertain as to why this helps some video
drivers, but not others.  Use at your discretion.
