Before you build the Qt library and example programs, you must run the
"configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  You can use the -platform option to specify the operating
system and compiler you are using.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  aix-g++        hpux-g++       linux-g++    reliant-cds     ultrix-g++
  aix-xlc        hpux-n64       linux-cxx    sco-g++   	     unixware-g++
  bsdi-g++       hpux-o64       linux-kcc    solaris-64      unixware7-cc
  dgux-g++       hurd-g++       netbsd-g++   solaris-cc      unixware7-g++
  freebsd-g++    irix-g++       openbsd-g++  solaris-g++
  hpux-acc       irix-cc        qnx-g++      tru64-cxx
  hpux-cc        irix-cc-64     reliant-64   tru64-g++

Limitations:

  ultrix-g++ does not support shared libraries, use static.
  qnx-g++ is experimental only. Expect some problems.

Compilation problems:

  Qt 3.x has problems compiling on some combinations of operating
  system versions and compiler versions.  Information about such
  problems will be posted on http://www.trolltech.com/platforms/
  as we become aware of them.

Example:

  ./configure -platform irix-cc-64 -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files
  to the mkspecs directory.  Use existing similar configurations
  as a starting point.
