                          INSTALLING Qt/X11 Version %VERSION%.

1.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license
    file as $HOME/.qt-license.

    For the open source version you do not need a license file.

2.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

        cd /tmp
        gunzip %DISTNAME%.tar.gz        # uncompress the archive
        tar xvf %DISTNAME%.tar          # unpack it

    This creates the directory /tmp/%DISTNAME% containing the files
    from the archive.

3.  Building

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type:
        
        cd /tmp/%DISTNAME%
        ./configure

    Type "./configure -help" to get a list of all available options.

    To create the library and compile all the demos, examples, tools
    and tutorials type:

        make

    To install the library, demos, examples, tools
    and tutorials type:

        make install

    Qt is by default installed into /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%
    but this can be changed by using the -prefix parameter.

4.  Environment variables

    In order to use Qt, some environment variables needs to be
    extended.

        PATH               - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH    - only needed for compilers that do not
                             support rpath

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:

        PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

        setenv PATH /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    If you use a different shell, please modify your environment variables
    accordingly.

5.  That's all. Qt is now installed.

    If you are new to Qt, we suggest that you take a look at the demos
    and examples to see Qt in action. Run the Qt Examples and Demos
    either by typing 'qtdemo' on the command line or through the
    desktop's Start menu.
