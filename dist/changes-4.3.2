Qt 4.3.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.3.0.

The Qt version 4.3 series is binary compatible with the 4.2.x, 4.1.x and
4.0.x series. Applications compiled for Qt 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 will continue to
run with Qt 4.3.

This version adds Academic Free License 3.0, Artistic License 2.0, Zope 2.1 
and EPL to the GPL Exception.
