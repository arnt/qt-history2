#78429

Qt 3.1 introduces many significant new features and many improvements
over the 3.0.x series. For an overview of the main changes between
3.0.x and 3.1, look at the changes-3.1.0-b1 file. This file describes
the changes between Qt 3.1 beta2 and Qt 3.1 final.


****************************************************************************
*			    General					   *
****************************************************************************

- Improved building Qt on MSVC.NET.

- Support XIM on Solaris.


****************************************************************************
*			   Library					   *
****************************************************************************

- QAccel
	Corrected illegal accelerator state when using multiple
	keysequences. (Resulted in no accels being triggered when in
	partial match). Only triggers on enabled accelerators and
	their enabled items. Eats all keys in a keysequence, not just
	the first and last.

- QCString
	Speed-optimized replace().

- QDataStream
	Applies for printable data streams only: If the version number
	of the device is less than 4, use the same streaming format
	was used in Qt 2.3 and earlier.

- QDataTable
	Respect read-only columns. Make it possible to swap columns.

- QDockWindow:
	Added a standard widget constructor (taking a QWidget *parent,
	const char *name and WFlags). Improved docking behavior.

- QFileDialog:
	Windows only: make Qt's filedialog work properly with network
	paths.

- QFontMetrics:
	Windows only: Fixed QFontMetrics::boundingRect( QChar c ) to
	work for non true type fonts.

- QHeader
	Speeded up sectionSizeHont() calculation which in return
	speeds up all size/label calculations of QHeader.

- QIconFactory
	Avoid infinite loops when recursively calling
	QPixmap::pixmap().

- QIconView
	Fixed navigation and selection with arrow keys. Some speedups
	when repainting.

- QKeySequence
	Treat unicode characters in string defined sequences
	correctly. So, now letters like Æ, Ø and Å should work as
	accelerators, even through translation files.

- QLayout
	alignmentRect() respects the layout's maximum size.

- QLineEdit
	Added signal lostFocus(). Doubleclicking only uses spaces as
	word bounderies for the selection now, not dots, commans,
	etc. Support doubleclick+mousemove selection.

- QListBox:
	Fixed the item which is passed into the contextMenuRequested()
	signal (this was sometimes wrong). Don't select items that are
	not selectable.

- QListView
	Shift selection in Extended mode now follows Windows
	Shift-selection standard. Erase empty area when drawing
	listviews without columns. Only drops on items that have drop
	enabled accept drops.

- QListViewItem
	Speeded up size claculation for multi-line items.

- QMainWindow
	Base the minimumSizeHint() on the sizeHint()s of the left and
	dock area (instead of the minimumSize()).

- QMenuBar
	Fixed broken Alt release detection. Fixed flickering. Fixed
	empty menubars resizing properly.

- QObject:
	Fixed return value of disconnect(). Fixed disconnect()ing
	SIGNALs from SIGNALs and disconnect()ing multiple euqally
	named SLOTs from a SIGNAL.

- QProcess
	Unix only: Don't eat the filedescriptors if a lot of processes
	(with short runtime) are started immediately after each other.

- QPSQLDriver
	Make the driver compile with the standard PostgreSQL source
	distribution under Windows. Better handling of network,
	datetime and geometrical datatypes.

- QRegion
	Fixed setRects() to calculate the bounding rectangle
	correctly.

- QScrollView
	Doesn't reposition the view when the user is scrolling the
	view.

- QSpinBox
	Fixed setValue() so that input yet not interpreted is ignored
	when setting a new value.

- QString
	Support QTextCodec::codecForCStrings(). Support
	string<-->QString conversation when STL support is on.

- QSyntaxHighlighter:
	Added function rehighlight(). Improved internals to be more
	efficient (less calls to highlightParagraph() necessary).

- QTable
	Fixed Tab/BackTab handling to always work. Fixed
	setColumnLabels() and setRowLabels().

- QTableItem (and subclasses)
	Supports now global struts. (see QApplication::globalStrut()).

- QTDSDriver
	Binary datatypes work now.

- QTextCodec
	Added QTextCodec::codecForCStrings and QTextCodec::codecForTr.

- QTextEdit
	Fixed a painting error which resulted in areas of the textedit
	not being erased correctly. Make sure to repaint is updated
	after changing the underline-links setting. Renamed
	'allowTabs' property to 'tabChangesFocus' (inverted
	value). Added a new property 'autoFormatting'. When exporting
	HTML also quote quotes. Fixed a background erasing bug which
	messed up the view.

- QUrl
	Recognize Windows drive letters not only in the form of "c:/"
	but also in the form "c:" (without the '/').

- QWidget
	Fixed some visibility issues.

****************************************************************************
*			   Qt Designer					   *
****************************************************************************

- Displays now the classname of "gray box" custom widgets in the gray
box on the form.

- Accept tildes (~) in the project settings.

- A new commandline tool conv2ui (in qt/tools/designer/tools) has been
added, to convert dialog description files from different file formats
to .ui files without the need to invoke Qt Designer. This tool uses
the same plugins as Qt Designer for loading other dialog desription
files.

- A import filter for .kdevdlg files has been added.

- Actions in the action editor are now sortable

- Improved usibility of more dialogs (in-place renaming, drag'n'drop,
etc.)

- Preserver creation order of forward declarations, variables, etc.

- Save comments also for actions.

- uic: Fixed generating code for QStringList properties.

****************************************************************************
*			   Qt Assistant					   *
****************************************************************************

- Fixed some accelerator conflicts.

****************************************************************************
*			   Qt Linguist					   *
****************************************************************************

- Handle trailing backslash in strings correctly in lupdate.
