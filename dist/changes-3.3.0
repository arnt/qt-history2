Qt 3.3 introduces new features as well as many improvements over the
3.2.x series. For more details, see the online documentation which is
included in this distribution. The documentation is also available at
http://doc.trolltech.com/

The Qt version 3.3 series is binary compatible with the 3.2.x series.
Applications compiled for 3.2 will continue to run with 3.3.

Qt Motif Extension
------------------


ActiveQt Extension
------------------
Two new functions, QAxFactory::startServer() and QAxFactory::stopServer(),
can be used to start and stop an out-of-process ActiveQt server in runtime. 
Server binaries no longer need to implement a main() entry point function.
A default implementation will be used for out-of-process servers.

COM objects developed with ActiveQt are now supported in a wider range of
standard clients, including Microsoft Office applications and .NET.

The QAxContainer library is now static even for shared configurations of Qt,
which simplifies depolyment and allows using of both QAxServer and 
QAxContainer in one project (ie. an OLE automatable application that uses
COM objects itself).
Calling of COM object methods with out-parameters of type short is now 
supported (the parameters are of type int& in the Qt wrapper), and QVariants
used for out-parameters don't have to be initialized to the expected type.
