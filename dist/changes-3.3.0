Qt 3.3 introduces new features as well as many improvements over the
3.2.x series. For more details, see the online documentation which is
included in this distribution. The documentation is also available at
http://doc.trolltech.com/

The Qt version 3.3 series is binary compatible with the 3.2.x series.
Applications compiled for 3.2 will continue to run with 3.3.

Qt library
----------

Two new database drivers has been added to the SQL module, Interbase
and SQLite. This makes it possible to write database applications that
does not require a database server.

Qt Motif Extension
------------------


ActiveQt Extension
------------------

Two new functions, QAxFactory::startServer() and
QAxFactory::stopServer(), can be used to start and stop an
out-of-process ActiveQt server in runtime. The new functions
QAxFactory::serverDirPath() and QAxFactory::serverFilePath() return
the location of the COM server binary. Server binaries no longer
need to implement a main() entry point function.  A default
implementation will be used for out-of-process servers. IClassFactory2
is supported for the development of licensed components, and
QAxFactory supports the creation of non-visual COM objects.  Class
specific information can be provided directly in the C++ class
declaration using the Q_CLASSINFO macro to control how objects and
controls are registered and exposed. New helper classes and macros
are avialable to make it even easier to expose object classes (see the
QAxServer documentation for details).

COM objects developed with ActiveQt are now supported in a wider range
of clients, including Microsoft Office applications and .NET. Examples
that demonstrate how to use the Qt objects from the examples in .NET
languages like C# are included. QStringList is supported as a type,
and QRect, QSize and QPoint are now supported datatypes for control
properties and as reference parameters. Saving the controls to a
storage or stream now includes the version number of the QDataStream
used for the serialization (note that this might break existing 
storages).

The QAxContainer library is now static even for shared configurations
of Qt, which simplifies deployment and allows using both QAxServer and
QAxContainer in one project (ie. an OLE automatable application that
uses COM objects itself). The semantic of QAxBase::setControl() has
been extended to allow creating of COM objects on remote machines via
DCOM, to create controls requiring a license key and to connect to
already running objects.  The implementation of QAxBase::dynamicCall()
has been improved to support passing of parameter values directly in
the function string. Three new classes, QAxScript, QAxScriptManager
and QAxScriptEngine, can be used to script COM objects from within Qt
applications using Windows Script Host.

SAFEARRAY(BSTR) parameters are supported as QStringList. Calling of
COM object methods with out-parameters of type short is now supported
(the parameters are of type int& in the Qt wrapper), and QVariants
used for out-parameters don't have to be initialized to the expected
type.  Calling QByteArray functions in out-of-process controls no
longer returns an error code. The control's client side is set to zero
when the container releases the control.

Qt 3.3.x does no longer officially support IRIX MIPSpro o32 or Sun CC
5.0.

- QAction
  Added a setDisabled() slot similar to QWidget::setDisabled, and a slot
  activate(). Actions with the "text" properties including '&' and with
  now "menuText" set explicitly encode the '&' to "&&" so that the ampersand
  is visible in the menu.

- QHeader
  The sizeChange() signal is emitted when the section sizes are adjusted by
  double clicking.

- QListView
  Improved alignment for text in QListViewItems. Right aligned text
  now have the ellipsis to the left.

- QWindowsStyle
  Qt supports toggeling of the accelerator underlines using the
  Alt-key on Windows 98, 2000 and later. On other platforms this
  change has no effect.

- QSound
  Windows: Support loop related APIs

- QStatusBar
  Draw messages with the foreground() color of the palette, not with
  text().

- QSql
  Support for Interbase and SQLite

- QTextEdit
  Added an accessor for the currently set QSyntaxHighlighter.
