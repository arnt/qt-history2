Here is a list of (major) changes in Qt from 0.96 to 0.98.
As usual, we fixed some bugs and improved the documentation.


moc:
----
  Moc previously gave a syntax error when the word "class" was found
  in a string outside a class declaration. This bug has now been
  fixed.

  More moc arguments, run "moc -h" for details.


QDate:
------
  These were protected, now private:
	static const char *monthNames[];
	static const char *weekdayNames[];
	uint  	 jd;

QFont:
------
  Two new convenience functions; bold() and setBold().

QLabel:
-------
  setMargin() and margin() are new. setMargin() specifies a minimum margin
  when the label contents are justified.


QListBox:
---------
  The internals of QListBox is completely reworked. Definition of custom
  QListBoxItems is now much easier. This is *not* compatible with the old
  way of defining custom QLBItems. 

QPainter:
--------
  Fixed bug in drawing of ellipse, pie and chord when NoPen is set.
  

QTime:
------
  This was protected, now private:
	uint   ds;


QWidget:
--------
  You can specify a custom widget frame for top level widgets, including
  no frame at all. See the widget constructor doc. for details.
  resize() and setGeometry() obeys the widget's minimum/maximim size.

  Qt now has enter and leave events. Reimplement the virtual functions  
  void enterEvent( QEvent * ) and void leaveEvent( QEvent * ) to receive
  events when the mouse cursor leaves or enters the visible part of the
  widget.

  The default behaviour of QWidget::closeEvent is now to hide the widget,
  not to delete it as before (Which was potentially dangerous)! This means
  that if you have a top level widget and the user closes it via the close
  box, it will now hide itself if you have not reimplemented closeEvent().
  See the QWidget::closeEvent() and QCloseEvent documentation for details.


Disabled copy constructors and operator=
----------------------------------------
  Copy constructors and operator= are disabled in the classes where
  they make no sense. This should lead to compile time errors where
  you would have got core dumps before. This is done in the following 
  classes:

  QAccel QApplication QBuffer QButton QButtonGroup QCheckBox QClipboard
  QComboBox QConnection QDataStream QDialog QFile QFileDialog QFrame
  QGroupBox QIODevice QImageIO QLCDNumber QLabel QLineEdit QListBox
  QMenuBar QMenuData QMenuItem QMessageBox QMetaObject QObject
  QPSPrinter QPaintDevice QPainter QPicture QPopupMenu QPrintDialog
  QPrinter QPushButton QRadioButton QRangeControl QScrollBar QSignal
  QSocketNotifier QTableView QTextStream QTimer QWidget QWindow
