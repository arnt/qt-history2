Here is a list of (major) changes in Qt from 0.96 to 0.98.
As usual, we fixed some bugs and improved the documentation.


copy constructors og operators=


moc:
----
  Moc previously gave a syntax error when the word "class" was found
  in a string outside a class declaration. This bug has now been
  fixed.

  More moc arguments, run "moc -h" for details.


QDate:
------
  These were protected, now private:
	static const char *monthNames[];
	static const char *weekdayNames[];
	uint  	 jd;

QFont:
------
  Two new convenience functions; bold() and setBold().

QLabel:
-------
  setMargin() and margin() are new. setMargin() specifies a minimum margin
  when the label contents are justified.


QListBox:
---------
  QLBItem replaced by more flexible QListBoxItem (for custom listbox
  entries).

QPainter:
--------
  Fixed bug in drawing of ellipse, pie and chord when NoPen is set.
  

QTime:
------
  This was protected, now private:
	uint   ds;


QWidget:
--------
  You can specify a custom widget frame for top level widgets, including
  no frame at all. See the widget constructor doc. for details.
  resize() and setGeometry() obeys the widget's minimum/maximim size.

  Qt now has enter and leave events. Reimplement the virtual functions  
  void enterEvent( QEvent * ) and void leaveEvent( QEvent * ) to receive
  events when the mouse cursor leaves or enters the visible part of the
  widget.

  The default behaviour of QWidget::closeEvent is now to hide the widget,
  not to delete it as before (Which was potentially dangerous)! This means
  that if you have a top level widget and the user closes it via the close
  box, it will now hide itself if you have not reimplemented closeEvent().
  See the QWidget::closeEvent() and QCloseEvent documentation for details.
