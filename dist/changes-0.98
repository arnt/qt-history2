Here is a list of (major) changes in Qt from 0.97 to 0.98.
As usual, we fixed some bugs and improved the documentation.


moc:
----
  Moc previously gave a syntax error when the word "class" was found
  in a string outside a class declaration. This bug has now been
  fixed.

  More moc arguments, run "moc -h" for details.


QDate:
------
  These were protected, now private:
	static const char *monthNames[];
	static const char *weekdayNames[];
	uint  	 jd;


QListBox:
---------
  QLBItem replaced by more flexible QListBoxItem (for custom listbox
  entries).


QTime:
------
  This was protected, now private:
	uint   ds;


QWidget:
--------
  You can specify a custom widget frame. See the widget constructor doc.
  resize() and setGeometry() obeys the widget's minimum/maximim size.
