Qt 3.0 Beta3 is not binary compatible with Beta2, this means that any
programs linked with Beta2 must be recompiled.

Below you'll find a description of general changes in the Qt Library
and Qt Designer followed by a detailed list of changes in the
programming API.


The Qt Library
========================================



Qt Designer
========================================



Qt Functions
========================================

QProcess
--------

 - The function hangUp() was renamed to tryTerminate() to make the purpose
   more clear. Furthermore, under Unix the signal that is sent was changed
   from SIGHUP to SIGTERM.

New function:
	void tryTerminate();

Removed function:
	void hangUp();
