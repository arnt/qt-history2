Qt 2.0 Beta3 is not binary compatible with Beta2, this means that any
programs linked with Beta2 must be recompiled.

The most important fixes since Beta 2:

QLayoutIterator/QGLayoutIterator
	The custom layout API has been changed: void removeCurrent()
	has been replaced by QLayoutItem* takeCurrent().

QLabel
	The functions setMargin() and margin() have been renamed to
	setIndent() and indent, to avoid collision with QFrame::setMargin()
