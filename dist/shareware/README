                   Qt 1.0 SHAREWARE X11 DISTRIBUTION

This is the shareware distribution of Qt 1.0 for X11.

Before starting to use Qt, you must install Qt as described in the INSTALL
file.

Qt is currently supported on Linux, Solaris, SunOS, FreeBSD, OSF/1, Irix,
BSD/OS, NetBSD, SCO and HP-UX. If you want to port Qt to a new platform,
read the PORTING file.

The HTML documentation in the html directory contains the reference
documentation of the Qt classes. Start your favorite Web browser with
the html/index.html file. There are also manual pages for each class.

If you are new to Qt it is a good idea to read the tutorial. It is located
in html/tutorial.html. The tutorial directory contains the programs used
in the tutorial.

All documentation is available as postscript from
http://www.troll.no/postscript.html

The example programs in the examples directory demonstrate some Qt
features. You can study these examples to get an overview of how Qt
programs can be written, or look at html/examples.html with your
browser.

See the FAQ for frequently asked questions about Qt; html/faq.html.
