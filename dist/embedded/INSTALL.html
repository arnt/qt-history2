<h1>Installing Qt/Embedded</h1>


<p>
This installation procedure is written for Linux/i386. It may need
to be modified for other platforms.

<h3>  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:</h3>
<pre>
	cd &lt;anywhere&gt;
	gunzip qt-embedded.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
	tar xf qt-embedded.tar       # unpack it
</pre>

  This document assumes that the archive is installed as <tt>~/qt-embedded</tt>.
</p>

<h3>  Install tmake</h3>

You need the newest tmake. (including linux-qws-g++) 
This should be available at the same place as the qt-embedded archive.

<p>
  This document assumes that tmake is installed as <tt>~/tmake</tt>.
</p>

<h3>  Set some environment variables </h3>

<pre>
	QTDIR			- wherever you installed Qt
	PATH			- to locate moc, tmake and so on
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH		- for the shared Qt library
	TMAKEDIR
	TMAKEPATH
</pre>
    for example...
<pre>
	export QTDIR=$HOME/qt-embedded
	export TMAKEDIR=$HOME/tmake

	export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH:$TMAKEDIR/bin
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export TMAKEPATH=$TMAKEDIR/lib/linux-qws-g++
</pre>

  
<p>
  Remember to re-source environment files, if necessary.
</p>


<h3> Compile the Qt/Embedded library and examples</h3>

<pre>
	cd ~/qt-embedded
	make
</pre>

<h3> Enable framebuffer support</h3>

<p>
   You may need to recompile your kernel to enable the framebuffer.
   This document does not describe how to do this; the file
   HOWTO-Framebuffer contains a short description. (You should see
   a penguin logo at boot time when the frame buffer is enabled.)

<p>
   For Matrox G100/G200/G400 use the matrox frame buffer driver.

<p>
   For Mach64 and most other cards, use the vesafb driver.


<p>
   Note that some cards are only supported in VGA16 mode, this will
   not work with the current version of Qt/Embedded, since VGA/16 is
   not yet supported. You may need to upgrade your kernel, or even
   switch to an experimental kernel.

<p>
   The frame buffer must also be enabled with a boot parameter. See
   <tt>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb</tt> for details.

<p>
   The fbset program, which should be included in Linux distributions,
   may be used to switch video modes without rebooting the system. The
   video mode active when the server is started will be used. (8-bit
   modes are still experimental.) NOTE: fbset does not work with the vesafb
   driver.
</p>

<h3> Change permissions</h3>

<p>
   To run Qt/Embedded, you need write access to the framebuffer device
   <tt>/dev/fb0</tt>. 

<p>
   You also need read access to the mouse device. (Note that
   <tt>/dev/mouse</tt> is normally a symbolic link; the actual mouse device
   must be readable.)
</p>



<h3> How to run the demonstration program</h3>

<p>
   Log into a virtual console and do:

<pre>
	cd ~/qt-embedded/
   	./start-demo
</pre>
  

<h3> Miscellaneous troubleshooting and known bugs</h3>

<p>
  To kill gpm, run the following command as root:
  
<pre>
	gpm -k
</pre>

<p>
  In some cases, if the server does not work, it will work when run as root.

<p>
  Some example programs may not compile with gcc 2.95.


<p>
  Show processes using the framebuffer:

<pre>
    fuser -v /dev/fb0
</pre>

<p>
  Kill such processes:
<pre>
    fuser -vk /dev/fb0
</pre>
  or harsher:
<pre>
    fuser -k -KILL /dev/fb0
</pre>


<p>
  Show existing semaphores:

<pre>
    ipcs            
</pre>
 
<p>
  Remove semaphores:

<pre>
    ipcrm
</pre>

<p>
  The communication between client and server is done through the
  named pipe <tt>/tmp/.QtEmbedded</tt>; sometimes it may need to be deleted
  (eg. if you run Qt/Embedded as root then later as an unprivileged user).
</p>


<h3> Customization  </h3>

<p>
   The Qt/Embedded library can be further reduced in size by removing
   unneeded features. The file <tt>qt-embedded/src/tools/qfeatures.h</tt>
   defines macros of the form <tt>QT_FEATURE_XXXX</tt>. To remove a feature
   from Qt/Embedded, set the macro to 0.
