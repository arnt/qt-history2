Before you build the Qt/Embedded library and example programs, you must
run the "configure" script to set the platform information and other build
settings.  Use the -embedded option to specify the operating system
and compiler you are compiling FOR. The host machine is required to be running
Linux and gcc.

Supported platforms and compilers:

  x86           - Use g++ of host machine, add x86 options.

Compilation problems:

  Information about problems will be posted on:
  http://www.trolltech.com/developer/platforms/ as we become aware of them.

Example:

  ./configure -embedded x86 -shared -debug

Customization:

  You can create your own custom configuration by adding new files to
  the mkspecs/qws directory.
