			  INSTALLING Qt/Embedded


This installation procedure is written for Linux/i386. It may need
to be modified for other platforms.
 
Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

cd <anywhere>
gunzip qt-qws-2.2.0.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
tar xf qt-qws-2.2.0.tar       # unpack it

This document assumes that the archive is installed as ~/qt-2.2.0

Compile the Qt/Embedded library and examples:

cd ~/qt-2.2.0
export QTDIR=~/qt-2.2.0
./configure
make

You will require a working Linux framebuffer to use Qt/Embedded.

Set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/qt-2.2.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To run the demo:

cd ~/qt-2.2.0/examples/launcher
./start_demo

See the HTML documentation in docs/html for detailed installation
instructions.
