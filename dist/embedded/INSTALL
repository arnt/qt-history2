Guide to installing the Qt/Embedded demo

1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd <anywhere>
	gunzip qt-embedded.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xf qt-embedded.tar	        # unpack it

2. Enable framebuffer support

   You may need to recompile your kernel to enable the framebuffer.
   This document does not describe how to do this, the file
   README-Framebuffer.embedded contains a short description. (You
   should see a penguin logo at boot time when the frame buffer is
   enabled. This is NOT the same as the penguin login prompt )

   For Matrox G100/G200/G400 use the matrox frame buffer driver.

   For Mach64 and most other cards, use the vesafb driver.

   Note that some cards are only supported in VGA16 mode, this will
   not work with the current version of Qt/Embedded, since VGA/16
   is not yet supported. You may need to upgrade your kernel, or even
   switch to an experimental kernel.

   The frame buffer must also be enabled with a boot parameter. See
   usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/ for details.

   The fbset program, which should be included in Linux distributions,
   may be used to switch video modes without rebooting the system. The
   video mode active when the server is started will be used. (8-bit
   modes not yet supported.) NOTE: fbset does not work with the vesafb
   driver.


3. Change permissions

   To run Qt/Embedded, you need write access to the framebuffer
   device /dev/fb0.


4. How to run the demo

   The package includes all the libraries your Linux system might need,
   in the qt-embedded/lib directory - they will be used from there directly.
   Qt/Embedded doesn't actually need much from the standard libraries, but
   we have included them in this package to simplify installation.

   Log in to a virtual console, change directory to the "qt-embedded"
   directory, then run the "start_demo" script.
