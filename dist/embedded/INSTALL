			  INSTALLING Qt/Embedded


This installation procedure is written for Linux. It may need to be
modified for other platforms.
 
Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

cd <anywhere>
gunzip qt-embedded-%VERSION%-commercial.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
tar xf qt-embedded-%VERSION%-commercial.tar       # unpack it

This document assumes that the archive is installed as ~/qt-%VERSION%

Compile the Qt/Embedded library and examples:

cd ~/qt-%VERSION%
export QTDIR=~/qt-%VERSION%
./configure
make

You will require a working Linux framebuffer to use Qt/Embedded.

Set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/qt-%VERSION%/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To run the demo:

cd ~/qt-%VERSION%/examples/launcher
./start_demo

See the HTML documentation in docs/html for detailed installation
instructions.
