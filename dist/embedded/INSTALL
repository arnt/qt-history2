			  INSTALLING Qt/Embedded


This installation procedure is written for Linux. It may need to be
modified for other platforms.
 
Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

cd <anywhere>
gunzip qt-embedded-%VERSION%-commercial.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
tar xf qt-embedded-%VERSION%-commercial.tar       # unpack it

This document assumes that the archive is installed as ~/qt-%VERSION%

Compile the Qt/Embedded library and examples:

cd ~/qt-%VERSION%
export QTDIR=~/qt-%VERSION%
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/qt-%VERSION%/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure
make

You will require a working Linux framebuffer to use Qt/Embedded.

To run the demo:

cd ~/qt-%VERSION%/examples/launcher
./start_demo

See the HTML documentation in doc/html for detailed installation
instructions.

Note for cross-compilation:

Certain tools such as moc and uic are required to run on the host machine
therefore are to be built natively. The uic tool also requires a native Qt
library which means the first step in cross-compilation when requiring uic is
to do a native build to generate the required native libraries and tools.
This only needs to be done once. You may also find if you have KDE installed
that you already have a native Qt library and native uic tool so it can be
possible to save time and skip this step in special cases. You can then
provide an -xplatform argument to configure to continue the cross-platform
build process following the procedures below.
