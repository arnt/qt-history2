Frequently Asked Questions for the Qt/Embedded platform
-------------------------------------------------------


General questions
-----------------


Q. When will Qt/Embedded be released?
A. General release is targeted for Q3 2000. Pre-releases may be available
   earlier.


Q. How is Qt/Embedded licensed?
A. - Application programmers will need a standard Qt Professional Edition
     license for the Qt/Embedded platform, available under terms similar to
     those for Qt/X11 and Qt/Windows.
   - Re-distributors of the Qt/Embedded library (generally hardware vendors)
     will require run-time license Qt/Embedded per-device.


Q. What does it cost?
A. The Qt/Embedded Professional Edition is available under terms
   similar to those for Qt/X11 and Qt/Windows. The price of the
   runtime licenses vary with the number of licenses purchased. Please
   e-mail sales@trolltech.com for details.


Q. Will it be possible for third parties to write commercial software for
   Qt/Embedded devices?
A. Yes. All Qt/Embedded Professional Edition licensees can produce commercial
   software that runs on a Qt/Embedded platform.  All current Professional
   Edition licensees will be notified directly after the final Qt/Embedded
   release.



Open Source issues
------------------

Q. Can I write Open Source software for Qt/Embedded devices?
A. The details are not finalized yet, but we plan to make a Free Edition
   of the development kit available that will make it possible to write
   free/Open Source software for Qt/Embedded-based devices. This will open
   the possibility to offer end-users to add applications, in the same way
   that end-users currently do for e.g. the 3Com Palm devices.

   The vast amount of Open Source software already written using the
   Qt Free Edition is expected to be trivially portable to Qt/Embedded.


Q. Will there be a free/Open Source version that I can put on my own
   hobbyist embedded device?
A. This is not decided yet. This question involves some very difficult
   licensing issues that will take time to resolve.



Technical Questions
-------------------

Q. How much memory does Qt/Embedded require?
A. Qt/Embedded can be configured to for ROM requirements between 1M and 3M,
   depending on what features are enabled.  Fonts are very small (about 80%
   smaller than the same fonts under X11), and Qt/Embedded can be configured
   to supports the PNG and JPEG image formats, which are memory-efficient.
   Due to the rich feature set of Qt, applications are generally much smaller
   than those using other toolkits or direct X11.


Q. What platforms does Qt/Embedded support?
A. All platforms supported by Linux are also supported by Qt/Embedded. This
   includes CPUs based on the ARM, i386, Motorola 68000, MIPS, PowerPC chips.
   Other embedded Linux platforms under being developed by various groups
   and vendors.


Q. Is Qt/Embedded supported on platforms other than Linux?
A. Qt is highly portable, and Trolltech offers expert porting services
   to those with special requirements.


Q. Is Qt/Embedded designed to replace X for general desktop usage?
A. This is not its design goal. Qt/Embedded is targeted towards
   usage in embedded systems. It is however a full implementation of Qt,
   and is capable of running any portable Qt based program.


Q. Why not just use X?
A. Qt/Embedded has much lower RAM and ROM requirements than X. Clients
   also access the display directly for optimal graphics performance.
   Additional features such as anti-aliased fonts and alpha blending, not
   offered by X, are also available.
 

Q. Can I develop software with the current version of Qt/X11 or Qt/Win32
   and easily change to Qt/Embedded when it becomes available?
A. Yes. Qt/Embedded is source code compatible with Qt 2.1, so any
   program that works with 2.1 will work with Qt/Embedded (as long
   as it does not contain platform-dependent code, of course).
 

Q. Can it run multiple applications simultaneously? With overlapped windows?
A. Yes. Qt/Embedded includes a window management system.


Q. How does Qt/Embedded access the display?
A. The Qt/Embedded applications access the video framebuffer directly.
   Accelerated drivers for Qt/Embedded can also be used for improved
   performance. Such drivers access the graphics hardware directly to
   utilize any available hardware acceleration of graphics operations.
 

Q. Will Qt/Embedded have network transparent display like X?
A. No. Qt/Embedded is optimized for direct display access and it is not
   planned to include remote display capability. Qt/Embedded is designed
   to avoid the performance penalty of the X Server round-trip and context
   switches for the graphics operations.


Q. Will Qt/Embedded offer support for international languages / Unicode/
   internationalization?
A. Yes, at the same level as the desktop versions of Qt.


Q. What kind of font support does Qt/Embedded offer?
A. Qt/Embedded has support for TrueType and BDF fonts, both anti-aliased
   and conventional. The fonts can be pre-rendered for CPU and storage
   savings. The fonts are shared between applications.
