			INSTALLING Qt/Embedded for MIPS


The mips cross-compilation tools from http://www.linux-vr.org/tools.html
are supported by this version of Qt/Embedded.

Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

cd <anywhere>
gunzip qt-embedded-%VERSION%-commercial.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
tar xf qt-embedded-%VERSION%-commercial.tar       # unpack it

This document assumes that the archive is installed as ~/qt-%VERSION%

Compile the Qt/Embedded library and examples:

cd ~/qt-%VERSION%
export QTDIR=~/qt-%VERSION%
export DASHCROSS=-mips
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/qt-%VERSION%/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure -xplatform linux-mips-g++
make

HTML documentation.
