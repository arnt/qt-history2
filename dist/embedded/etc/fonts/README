The fonts here are in various formats:

    *.ttf - TrueType fonts, requires QT_FEATURE_TRUETYPE
    *.bdf - BDF fonts, requires QT_FEATURE_BDF
    *.qpf - Qt prerendered fonts, generated automatically from above fonts

Normally, small embedded devices will only use QPF files, and these will only
contain the subset of Unicode appropriate for the device.
