The fonts here are in various formats:

    *.ttf - TrueType fonts, requires QT_FEATURE_TRUETYPE
    *.bdf - BDF fonts, requires QT_FEATURE_BDF
    *.qbf/.qlf - Qt prerendered fonts (QPF format), generated automatically 
		 from above fonts.

Normally, small embedded devices will only use QPF files, and these will only
contain the subset of Unicode appropriate for the device. QPF is an
endian-dependent format; .qbf is for big-endian devices, .qlf for
little-endian devices
