If you want to enable built-in GIF image reading support in Qt, consult
the header file qgif.h in qt/include.

Qt/Embedded is currently supported on Linux.  Trolltech can be contracted
to port to other platforms.  Contact info@trolltech.com for more details.

The HTML documentation in the doc/html directory contains the reference
documentation of the Qt classes. Start your favorite Web browser with the
doc/html/index.html file. There are also manual pages for each class.

If you are new to Qt it is a good idea to read the tutorial. It is located
in doc/html/tutorial.html. The tutorial directory contains the programs
used in the tutorial.

The example programs in the examples directory demonstrate some Qt
features. You can study these examples to get an overview of how Qt
programs can be written, or look at doc/html/examples.html with your
browser.

See the Qt FAQ for frequently asked questions about Qt - html/faq.html; and
