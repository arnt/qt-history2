Welcome to the Preview of the next-generation embedded Linux port of Qt

Dear Trolltech embedded user,

We are pleased to present our Preview release, based on Qt 4.0.1, 
for the next-generation embedded Linux port of Qt. We are releasing
this code snapshot to our users because we want to show you the new 
technologies that will go into the final release, and because we 
want you to have the opportunity to give us your feedback. The 
feedback we receive will help us to ensure that the final release 
provides as much value and productivity as possible.

This product preview is licensed under a non-commercial license.
It is not meant to be used in production code or even for 
application development.

You can write new small programs just to experience what the
next generation of Qt4-based embedded programming will be like. 

In particular, this product makes use of the five new Qt 4 
technologies:
- A new set of template container classes	
- A model/view architecture for item views
- The Qt 4 painting framework
- The Unicode text renderer with a public API for performing
  low-level text layout
- Main-window, a modern action-based main-window, toolbar, 
  menu, and docking architecture.

We hope that besides improving productivity of our customers
and refining the quality of their software, we can make 
embedded development with Qt 4-based technology a lot more 
pleasurable. 

This product profits from all the improvements that have been
introduced in Qt 4 and is a huge technological leap over
previous embedded Qt offerings.

Since the last preview, we have made improvements all around the
embedded Linux port of Qt but in particular we have significantly 
enhanced rendering performance.

We would like to point out that even though we are committed to
bringing unparallel embedded performance in this product,
most of our improvements in the performance area did not make it 
into this preview release. Among those improvements are:
- elimination of the floating point usage in most areas,
- introduction of the hardware accelerated rendering framework. 
  For devices that support it we are planning to utilize EGL and 
  OpenVG to redefine graphics performance on embedded devices.
- general improvements in the non-accelerated paths in the rendering
  framework. 

So, keep this in mind if you attempt to start porting your 
Qt/embedded 2 or 3 based projects over. See qt4-getting-started.html 
to get an overview of the main portability issues or porting.html 
for a more in depth description.

For a more detailed description of the Qt 4 features, which constitute
the core of this embedded technology, please consult qt4-intro.html 
found in doc/html.

How to Provide Feedback

Roadmap

We plan a commercial release of the next generation embedded Linux 
port of Qt early Q4 2005.

Enjoy the Technology Preview. We hope you will have as much fun and
pleasure experimenting as we had designing and building it.
