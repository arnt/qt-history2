programs and the documentation.


                        COPYRIGHT AND RESTRICTIONS

1. All intellectual property rights in the Software are owned by Trolltech
AS and are protected by Norwegian copyright laws, other applicable
copyright laws, and international treaty provisions. Trolltech AS retains
all rights not expressly granted. No title, property rights or copyright
in the Software or in any modifications to the Software shall pass to the
Licensee under any circumstances.

2. The Licensee may not loan, rent, lease, or license the Software or any
copy. The Licensee may not alter or remove any details of ownership,
copyright, trade mark or other property right connected with the
Software. The Licensee may not disclose any source code or any concepts
and methods therein for any purpose other than as specifically provided
in this Agreement.

3. Some groups of files in the Software are designated as Modules. These
files contain specific notices defining the Module of which they are a
part. The Licensed Modules are those Modules of the Software specified
in the license certificate. The files of the Software which are not part
of any Module will herein be referred to as the Base Software.

4. The Licensee may use the Base Software and the Licensed Modules on the
platform(s) specified in the license certificate, to develop any kind of
product, except products which would compete with the Software. A product
that satisfies this section will herein be referred to as the Product.

5. The Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise
dispose of, the Software or any part thereof, solely or as a part of the
Product, its source code, in binary/compiled, or in any other form,
except as provided by a separate distribution agreement with Trolltech
AS. Such an agreement, if any, will be referred to as the Distribution
Agreement.

6. Notwithstanding the limitation set forth in Article 5, the Licensee
may distribute the Product in binary/compiled form, dynamically
linked against the Software, provided the only parts of the
Software included in the Product are derived from the header files
of the Software, and that no other parts of the Software are
distributed in any form.

7. Any rights additional to this license are by written agreement with
Trolltech AS.

                         LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED
HEREIN, TROLLTECH AS MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THEIR
QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOFTWARE IS WITH THE LICENSEE.

Because software is inherently complex and may not be completely free of
errors, the Licensee is advised to verify his work and make backup copies
where appropriate. In no event will Trolltech AS be liable for any
damages whatsoever including - but not restricted to - lost revenue or
profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental, cover, or
consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the
Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, except to
the extent invariable law, if any, provides otherwise.
