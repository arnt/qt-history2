The fonts here are in various formats:

    *.ttf - TrueType fonts, requires QT_FEATURE_TRUETYPE
    *.bdf - BDF fonts, requires QT_FEATURE_BDF
    *.pfa - PostScript fonts, used as source material for some QPF fonts
    *.qpf - Qt prerendered fonts (QPF format) rendered from above fonts.

Normally, small embedded devices will only use QPF files, and these will only
contain the subset of Unicode appropriate for the device. QPF is a portable,
endian-independent format.
