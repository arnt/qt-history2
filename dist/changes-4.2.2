Qt 4.2.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.2.0.

The Qt version 4.2 series is binary compatible with the 4.1.x and 4.0.x
series. Applications compiled for 4.0 or 4.1 will continue to run with 4.2.

General Improvements
--------------------

- Configuration/Compilation

  * Fixed issues with unresolved zlib symbols on aix-g++ resulting from a
    missing "-lz" in gui/Makefile.

  * Fixed compilation when an unsupported version of MySQL is auto-detected
    by the configure script.

  * Fixed QtDBus linking errors when compiling with the Intel C++ Compiler
    for Linux.

  * Fixed compilation when using Q_ARG and Q_RETURN_ARG macros with template
    types.

  * Make Qt compile with QT_NO_TOOLTIP and QT_NO_STATUSBAR

- Demos / Examples

  * Fixed crash in the Settings Editor example resulting from entering
    certain input to a QTreeWidget using QLineEdit as an inline editor.

  * Fixed crash in the Ported Canvas example that occurred when creating a
    new canvas from one that was shrunk to its minimum size.

- Qt Designer


Third party components
----------------------

- libpng

  * Security fix CVE-2006-5793: Using smaller sizeof(png_sPLT_t)
    instead of correct sizeof(png_sPLT_entry) to allocate memory may
    result in overflows.

  * Security fix (no CVE reference): Avoid profile larger than iCCP chunk.
    One might crash a decoder by putting a larger profile inside the iCCP
    profile than is actually expected.

  * Security fix (no CVE reference): NULL pointer dereferences. Found by
    Coverity scan of the Mozilla source code.

  * Disabled MMX assembler code for Intel-Mac platforms to work around a
    compiler bug.

General improvements
--------------------

- Accessibility

  * Fixed a potential assert when navigating menus while assistive tools are
    running.

  * Fixed a crash when getting accessibility information from an item view
    without a model.

  * Fixed item view accessibility bug where QAccessibleInterface::text()
    would return an empty string for child indexes larger
    than one.

- Item views

  * Fixed QHeaderView and QTableView overflow issues when the length
    of all the rows or columns went over the maximum allowed integer value.

  * When reset is emitted by a QAbstractItemModel, QHeaderView will now
    always update the header count().

  * Fixed incorrect scrolling in QHeaderView when items are hidden.

  * QDataWidgetMapper::mappedWidgetAt() now always returns the right
    mapped index for a widget no matter in which order they were inserted

  * Fixed crash due to incorrect update of persistent model indexes in
    QSortFilterProxyModel::layoutChanged().

  * Fixed bug that could cause QSortFilterProxyModel::removeRows() and
    QSortFilterProxyModel::removeColumns() to remove the wrong source model
    items.

  * Fixed bug in QSortFilterProxyModel that caused stale proxy mappings to
    remain when source model items were removed and later reinserted,
    resulting in an incorrect proxy model.

  * Fixed bug in QSortFilterProxyModel that caused items to not appear
    in a QTreeView when adding children to a formerly childless source item.

  * Fixed painting bug for spanning cells in QTableView when the item
    background is transparent.

  * Fixed regression in QListWidget and QTreeWidget that caused persistent
    indexes to not be updated when sorting items.

  * Fixed crash in Q3IconView when selecting several items without releasing
    the left mouse button, then clicking the right mouse button.

  * Enter key can now be used to start item editing when the edit trigger
    is AnyKeyPressed.

  * Fixed regression where QAbstractItemView::setRootIndex() wasn't
    always updating the view, causing possibly painting errors.

  * Fixed regression that caused incorrect propagation of Enter key press
    from a QAbstractItemView in editing mode.

  * Date and time editors are now initialized correctly with the current
    date and time.

  * QTableView tab focus handling has been improved. Although tab key
    navigation is enabled by default, you can tab out of a view if the
    model is either missing or unable to handle the key (e.g., an empty
    model).

- Graphics View

  * The background cache in QGraphicsView is now properly initialized to
    the full viewport.

  * Fixed incorrect cursor updates when moving between items.

  * QGraphicsItem::setMatrix() now properly clears the original item before
    repainting.

  * QGraphicsEllipseItem is now drawn as a full ellipse at angles ..., -720, -360,
    360, 720, ... only.

  * Fixed a crash when selecting one selectable item, then moving another
    movable item.

  * Fixed a crash during item construction caused by a pure virtual function
    call in QGraphicsItem.

  * Fixed mouse grabber book-keeping problems in QGraphicsScene which fell out
    of sync when opening modal dialogs or popups from within a mouse event
    handlers.

  * QGraphicsScene now forwards unhandled events to QObject, allowing the use
    of timers in QGraphicsScene subclasses.

- Meta-Object Compiler (moc)

  * Split long string literals in the generated code to work around
    limitations in MSVC.

  * Fixed crash on *BSD that could occur on invalid input.

- Painting

  * Improved numerical stability in the path stroker, fixing a crash when
    stroking paths containing curve segments whose control points are
    approximately on the same line.

  * Fixed raster paint engine memory corruption in QBitmap when source buffer
    was smaller than the destination buffer.

  * Avoid rounding errors when drawing parts of a pixmap using the Quartz 2D
    engine.

  * Added caching of QGradient's color table for the raster paint engine.
    This means that if a gradient with the same stops and colors is used
    again, it will be quickly fetched from the cache, avoiding the
    expensive calculations of the color lookup table.

  * Fixed a crash on Windows and with QImage caused by specifying
    Qt::CustomDashLine without an actual pattern.

  * Fixed a bug in the raster paint engine which would occasionally cause
    pixel errors when drawing polygons.

  * Fixed memory corruption in the OpenGL paint engine when drawing complex
    polygons with a cosmetic pen.

  * Fixed bug in the raster paint engine where extra lines would be drawn
    when drawing a path partially outside the viewport using a dashed pen.

  * Fixed an assert in QImage that was triggered when reading PNG files
    with certain palettes.

  * Fixed an issue where stroking and drawing aliased QPainterPaths with a
    non-cosmetic pen would produce incorrect results.

  * Fixed an issue where text was cut off when drawn onto a QImage.

  * Fixed an issue where text would be drawn onto a QPicture with an
    incorrect position.

  * Fixed an issue where enabling/disabling clipping when drawing into a
    QImage did not have any effect.

- Style Sheets

  * Made general performance improvements.

  * Fixed crash that could occur when a widget with a style sheet was
    reparented into a widget with no style sheet.

  * Ensured that a widget's custom palette is not overwritten when not styled
    using a style sheet.

  * Added support to allow colors to be specified with alpha components.

- SQL plugins

  * Fixed incorrect translation of error strings in the Oracle plugin.
  
  * Made sure PQfreemem is called to free allocated buffers in PostgreSQL.

  * Prevented possible trailing garbage for TEXT fields in the MySQL plugin.

- Text handling

  * Fixed a bug in the Bidi algorithm.

- QAbstractItemView

  * Made commitData() more robust by ignoring cases in which no valid index
    is associated with the editor.

  * Ensured that the itemEntered() signal is emitted consistently on all
    platforms.

- QCalendarWidget

  * Fixed setting the text format(Repainting & date reset issues are corrected).

- QComboBox

  * Fixed wrong scroll arrows for the popup menu.

- QCompleter

  * Fixed issue where the highlighted() signal was emitted twice if
    setModel() was called twice.

  * Made completers usable inside dialogs.

- QDataStream

  * Fixed streaming of qreal on (embedded) platforms where qreal values are
    not equivalent to double values; i.e., sizeof(qreal) != sizeof(double).

- QDialogButtonBox

  * QDialogButtonBox now sets the default button to the first button with
    the Accept role if no other button has explicitly been set as the
    default when it is shown. This is to stop a regression where using the
    autoDefault property with the Mac and Cleanlooks styles would set the
    Cancel button as the default.

- QDir

  * Fixed an assert in QDir::entryList() when reading file entries with
    names containing invalid Unicode encodings.

- QFileSystemWatcher

  * Fixed compilation on Linux/HPPA.

- QFSFileEngine

- QDateTimeEdit

  * Fixed a bug that allowed you to type in larger numbers than 12 in 12-hour
    fields.

  * Fixed a bug that occurred when QDate::shortMonthName() was longer than
    3 characters.

  * Improved the handling of left-to-right languages.

- QLineEdit

  * Fixed scrolling in line edits with custom paddings.

  * Fixed crash on Linux when the text contains QChar::LineSeparator.

- QLocale

  * Fixed crash on Mac OS X caused when one of the separator strings is an
    empty string.

- QObject

  * Fixed memory leak when calling QObject::moveToThread(0).

- QProgressBar

  * Document that drawing of text in vertical progress bars is style-dependent.

- QSqlRelationalTableModel

  * Ensured that the internal cache is correctly cleared when reverting
    inserted rows.

  * Fixed race-condition in QTextCodec::codecForLocale().

- QTextDocument

  * Fixed support for pixel font sizes in imported HTML.

- QTextOption

  * Ensured that the textDirection property is respected.

- QTextStream

  * Ensured that readLine() no longer treats "\r\n" as being two lines if
    called after QTextStream::pos().

- QToolButton

  * Fixed an issue where tool button popup menus were positioned incorrectly
    on multi-screen setups.

- QTreeView/QTreeWidget

  * Fixed possible assert when painting if there were layouts pending.

  * Fixed possible segfault when a model emits layoutChanged().

  * Fixed erroneous expanding/collapsing of items when the user
    double-clicked in the checkbox area of an item.

  * Fixed a crash in setRowHidden() caused by hiding then un-hiding items
    in a hierarchy.

    (Fixing a bug in QtSingleApplication on Windows.)

  * Made QWidget::restoreGeometry() restore windows to the correct screen
    on multi-screen systems.

  * Fixed a bug where the stacking order of widgets would get out of sync
    and cause entire widgets, or parts of them, not to be updated properly.

  * Fixed QWidget::setParent() to not recreate the native window ID of
    all child widgets when reparenting the parent to top-level.

- QWorkspace

  * Fixed memory corruption that caused crashes inside Visual Studio.

- Qt3 support

  * Fixed QPainter::xForm() and QPainter::xFormDev().
