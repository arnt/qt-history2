Qt 4.2.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.2.0.

The Qt version 4.2 series is binary compatible with the 4.1.x and 4.0.x
series.  Applications compiled for 4.0 or 4.1 will continue to run with 4.2.

     by the configure script

Demos / Examples

  * Fixed crash in settingseditor example resulting from entering certain input to

  * Fixed crash in portedcanvas example resulting from creating a new canvas from
    one that was shrunk to its minimum size.

- Item views
      
      * Fixed possible assert in QTreeView when painting if there were
        layouts pending.
      
      * Fixed possible segfault in QTreeView when a model emits layoutChanged().
      
      * Fixed QHeaderView and QTableView overflow issues when the length
        of all the rows or columns went over max int.
      
      * When reset is emitted by a QAbstractItemModel, QHeaderView will now
        always update the header count().

      * Fixed regression where QAbstractItemView::setRootIndex() wasn't 
        always updating the view causing possibly painting errors.
      
      * Fixed QTreeWidget::setSortingEnabled() which could could cause
        incorrect painting.
      
      * Fixed incorrect scrolling in QHeaderView when items are hidden.

      * QDataWidgetMapper::mappedWidgetAt() now always returns the right
        mapped index for a widget no matter in which order they were inserted

      * QAbstractItemView::commitData() is made more robust by ignoring cases
        in which no valid index is associated with the editor

      * Fixed crash due to incorrect update of persistent model indexes in
        QSortFilterProxyModel::layoutChanged().

      * Fixed bug that could cause QSortFilterProxyModel::removeRows() and
        QSortFilterProxyModel::removeColumns() to remove the wrong source model
        items.

      * Fixed bug in QSortFilterProxyModel that caused stale proxy mappings to
        remain when source model items were removed and later reinserted,
        resulting in an incorrect proxy model.

      * Fixed bug in QSortFilterProxyModel that caused items to not appear
        in a QTreeView when adding children to a formerly childless source item.

      * Fixed painting bug for spanning cells in QTableView when the item
        background is transparent.

      * Fixed regression that caused incorrect propagation of Enter key press
        from a QAbstractItemView in editing mode.

      * Fixed erroneous expanding/collapsing of items in a QTreeView when
        double-clicking in the checkbox area of an item.

      * Fixed regression in QListWidget and QTreeWidget that caused persistent
        indexes to not be updated when sorting items.

      * Fixed crash in Q3IconView when selecting several items without releasing
        the left mouse button, then clicking the right mouse button.

      * Enter key can now be used to start item editing when the edit trigger
        is AnyKeyPressed.

      * Fixed crash in QTreeView::setRowHidden() when hiding and then un-hiding
        items in a hierarchy.

- Graphics View

  * The background cache in QGraphicsView is now properly initialized to
    the full viewport.

  * Fixed incorrect cursor updates when moving between items.

  * QGraphicsItem::setMatrix() now properly clears the original item before
    repainting.

  * QGraphicsEllipseItem is now drawn as a full ellipse at angles ..., -720, -360,
    360, 720, ... only.

- Painting

      * Fixed memory corruption in QBitmap when source buffer was smaller than
	the destination buffer (RasterEngine). 

- SQL plugins

      * Fixed incorrect translation of error strings in the Oracle plugin
      * Make sure PQfreemem is called to free allocated buffers in PostgreSQL
      * Prevent possible trailing garbage for TEXT fields in the MySQL plugin

- QSqlRelationalTableModel

      * Make sure the internal cache is correctly cleared when reverting inserted
        rows.
