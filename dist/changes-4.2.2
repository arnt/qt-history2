Qt 4.2.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.2.0.

The Qt version 4.2 series is binary compatible with the 4.1.x and 4.0.x
series.  Applications compiled for 4.0 or 4.1 will continue to run with 4.2.

    when called on a null variant.

- Item views
      
      * Fixed possible assert in QTreeView when painting if there were
        layouts pending.
      
      * Fixed possible segfault in QTreeView when a model emits layoutChanged().
      
      * Fixed QHeaderView and QTableView overflow issues when the length
        of all the rows or columns went over max int.
      
      * When reset is emitted by a QAbstractItemModel, QHeaderView will now
        always update the header count().

      * Fixed regression where QAbstractItemView::setRootIndex() wasn't 
        always updating the view causing possibly painting errors.
      
      * Fixed QTreeWidget::setSortingEnabled() which could could cause
        incorrect painting.
      
      * Fixed incorrect scrolling in QHeaderView when items are hidden.

      * QDataWidgetMapper::mappedWidgetAt() now always returns the right
        mapped index for a widget no matter in which order they were inserted

      * QAbstractItemView::commitData() is made more robust by ignoring cases
        in which no valid index is associated with the editor

      * Fixed crash due to incorrect update of persistent model indexes in
        QSortFilterProxyModel::layoutChanged().

      * Fixed bug that could cause QSortFilterProxyModel::removeRows() and
        QSortFilterProxyModel::removeColumns() to remove the wrong source model
        items.

      * Fixed bug in QSortFilterProxyModel that caused stale proxy mappings to
        remain when source model items were removed and later reinserted,
        resulting in an incorrect proxy model.

      * Fixed bug in QSortFilterProxyModel that caused items to not appear
        in a QTreeView when adding children to a formerly childless source item.

      * Fixed painting bug for spanning cells in QTableView when the item
        background is transparent.

      * Fixed regression that caused incorrect propagation of Enter key press
        from a QAbstractItemView in editing mode.

      * Fixed erroneous expanding/collapsing of items in a QTreeView when
        double-clicking in the checkbox area of an item.

      * Fixed regression in QListWidget and QTreeWidget that caused persistent
        indexes to not be updated when sorting items.

      * Fixed crash in Q3IconView when selecting several items without releasing
        the left mouse button, then clicking the right mouse button.

      * Enter key can now be used to start item editing when the edit trigger
        is AnyKeyPressed.

      * Fixed crash in QTreeView::setRowHidden() when hiding and then un-hiding
        items in a hierarchy.

      * QAbstractItemView now emits itemEntered() consistently in all
        platforms.

      * Date and time editors are now initialized correctly with the current
        date and time.

      * QTableView tab focus handling has been improved. Although tab key
        navigation is enabled by default, you can tab out of a view if the
        model is either missing or unable to handle the key (e.g., an empty
        model).

- Graphics View

  * The background cache in QGraphicsView is now properly initialized to
    the full viewport.

  * Fixed incorrect cursor updates when moving between items.

  * QGraphicsItem::setMatrix() now properly clears the original item before
    repainting.

  * QGraphicsEllipseItem is now drawn as a full ellipse at angles ..., -720, -360,
    360, 720, ... only.

  * Fixed a crash when selecting one selectable item, then moving another
    movable item.

  * Fixed a crash during item construction caused by a pure virtual function
    call in QGraphicsItem.

  * Fixed mouse grabber bookkeeping problems in QGraphicsScene which fell out
    of sync when opening modal dialogs or popups from within a mouse event
    handlers.

  * QGraphicsScene now forwards unhandled events to QObject, allowing the use
    of timers in QGraphicsScene subclasses.

- Painting

      * Fixed memory corruption in QBitmap when source buffer was smaller than
	the destination buffer (RasterEngine). 
      * Avoid rounding errors when drawing parts of a pixmap in the Quartz 2D engine.

      * Added caching of QGradient's colortable for QRasterPaintEngine.
        This means that if a gradient with the same stops and colors is used
        again, it will be quickly fetched from the cache, avoiding the
        expensive calculations of the color lookup table.

      * Improved numerical stability in the path stroker, fixing a crash when
        stroking paths containing curve segments whose control points are
        approximately on the same line.

      * Fixed bug in QRasterPaintEngine which would occasionally cause pixel
        errors when drawing polygons.

      * Fixed memory corruption in the QOpenGLPaintEngine when drawing complex 
        polygons with a cosmetic pen.

      * Fixed bug in QRasterPaintEngine where extra lines would be drawn when
        drawing a path partially outside of the viewport using a dashed pen.

- Style Sheets
      * Fixed crash when widget with stylesheet is reparented into widget with no stylesheet
      * Style Sheet performace improvements
      * Do not clobber widget's custom palette when not styled using stylesheet
      * Add support to specify alpha colors using rgba()
      
- SQL plugins

      * Fixed incorrect translation of error strings in the Oracle plugin
      * Make sure PQfreemem is called to free allocated buffers in PostgreSQL
      * Prevent possible trailing garbage for TEXT fields in the MySQL plugin

- QSqlRelationalTableModel

      * Make sure the internal cache is correctly cleared when reverting inserted
        rows.

- QSvg
    * Improved parser robustness and parsing speed

- QDialogButtonBox

    * QDialogButtonBox now sets the default button to the first button with the
      accept role if no other button has explicitly been set as the default
      when it is shown. This is to stop a regression where using the the
      autodefault property with the mac and cleanlooks style would set the
      cancel button as the default.

- QLocale

    * Don't crash on Mac OS X when one of the separator strings is an empty string.

- QMacStyle

    * Fix a crash when given an invalid rect for an inactive button.

- QSystemTrayIcon:

    * Properly handle the enable state of actions and emit aboutToShow() on the mac.

- QPlastiqueStyle:

    * Disabled checked radiobuttons and checkboxes are now rendered correctly.

- QProgressBar
    
    * Document that drawing of text in vertical progress bars is style dependent.
