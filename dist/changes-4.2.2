Qt 4.2.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.2.0.

The Qt version 4.2 series is binary compatible with the 4.1.x and 4.0.x
series.  Applications compiled for 4.0 or 4.1 will continue to run with 4.2.

General improvements
--------------------

- Item views
      
      * Fixed possible assert in QTreeView when painting if there were
        layouts pending.
      
      * Fixed possible segfault in QTreeView when a model emits layoutChanged().
      
      * Fixed QHeaderView and QTableView overflow issues when the length
        of all the rows or columns went over max int.
      
      * When reset is emited by a QAbstractItemModel, QHeaderView will now
        always update the header count().

      * Fixed regression where QAbstractItemView::setRootIndex() wasn't 
        always updating the view causing possibly painting errors.
      
      * Fixed QTreeWidget::setSortingEnabled() which could could cause
        incorrect painting.
