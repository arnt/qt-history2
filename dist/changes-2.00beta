The Qt version 2.x series is not binary compatible with the 1.x
series. This means programs compiled with Qt version 1.x must be
recompiled to work with Qt 2.0.

Qt 2.0 is mostly, but not completely, source compatible with Qt 1.x.
See the document "Porting from Qt 1.x to Qt 2.0" in the Online
Reference Documentation for information on how to port an existing
Qt 1.x-based program to Qt 2.0.
